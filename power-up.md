### I don't know why I made a Patreon

Any donation on **[Patreon](https://bit.ly/mrps-patreon)** gives you the **Powered Up** role on **[Discord](https://bit.ly/mrps-discord)**. That's literally it. It doesn't do anything at all. But you can wear it as you chat. So like I guess that's cool. Ok fine it isn't. But it would make ME happy to see someone wear it. So you should do it. For my happiness.

### Who doesn't have a podcast these days

I've made like almost none of them. I just wanted to try out the anchor service. It's a really good service and I highly recommend it. If you're into talking. I have no clue what to talk about. How do people talk endlessly for hours every day? Yhat is hard yo. I should just recite slam poetry or something at this point.
