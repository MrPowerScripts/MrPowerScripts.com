				<title>Host your own private docker registry with Portus</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;If you’re familiar with docker then you’ve probably used DockerHub. Dockerhub is AWESOME. I absolutely love (most of) it and what it does. DockerHub is simply a docker container registry. It’s a place where you can store, pull, and share docker containers. &lt;!-- (1) video wrapper --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;youtube-video&quot; data-embed=&quot;gvaRfAqCfGY&quot;&gt; 
 
    &lt;!-- (2) the &quot;play&quot; button --&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;play-button&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 
     
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not the only container registry. Google has their own container registry where you can upload your images. Microsoft and Amazon also have docker container registries. All of that is great, but what if you want to host your won docker images in a private registry. Those registries I mentioned have support for private accounts, but I’m going to reveal how you can host your own private container registry that you control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to automate this whole configuration process? I have a script that will set all of this up in 10 minutes! With some extra configuration that is very useful for a first install. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/mrps-portus-registry&quot;&gt;find a link to the script here&lt;/a&gt; or at the bottom of the page. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two requirements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A domain name&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The server is simple. I used at $10 Ubuntu 18.10 droplet on Digital Ocean configured with SSH access. Though it should work for 18.04 as well. When you can SSH into your server you’re ready for the next step&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you want to login to your docker registry using the docker client locally - as you do with DockerHub. In order for that to happen, there must be a secured connection between you and the registry (your server). Else docker will throw a fit and require all kinds of hacks to get things working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you’re going to need an SSL certificate from a trusted certifitate authority. We’re going to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org&quot;&gt;LetsEncrypt&lt;/a&gt; because it’s free and can be automated. I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.humankode.com/ssl/how-to-set-up-free-ssl-certificates-from-lets-encrypt-using-docker-and-nginx&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; to get my SSL cert on the server.  It explains everything you’ll need to make sure your domain is configured properly for secured connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have your domain configured properly and the SSL certificate is on the server you can start configuring the registry. Docker themselves maintains and releases &lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.docker.com/_/registry/&quot;&gt;a docker image&lt;/a&gt; that is a Docker registry. Yea, they put a docker container registry in a docker container. But there’s one problem. There’s no GUI. There’s no access control. It’s not that exciting by itself. If only there was some open source project built off this registry container that had all the cool bells and whistles included. Oh, right, there is. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SUSE/Portus&quot;&gt;Portus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portus is amazing. I’ll go over the Portus UI in the video, but it does basically everything you could want it to do. You can create accounts, teams, and namespaces. You can add access controls to make images private, private to logged in users, or public for anyone on the internet to use. The UI is very clean and well organized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.objectif-libre.com/en/blog/2018/06/11/self-hosting-a-secure-docker-registry-with-portus/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; put me in the right direction to configure Portus and get it running. Thankfully they have a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; file that can be used which spins up all the services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After modifying the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; from the blog article to use my own SSL certificate, and extra little config changes here and there to improve the experience, the Portus server is live!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’m able to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker login&lt;/code&gt; into my own secure private Docker registry where I can manage and share access to images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;###                                                                                     ##&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;### This script will turn an Ubuntu 18.04/10 server into a docker registry with a GUI   ##&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;###                                                                                     ##&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# This script was created thanks to a number of guides and other peoples efforts. Please check them out!&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# THis script is intended to be run on ubuntu 18.04 or 18.10. You must run it from the home directory (~).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# I was able to run the box fine on a $10 droplet from digital ocean.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# It will provision the enviroment, install an ssl cert from letsencrypt, and start the Portus registry service.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# You can login to your new docker registry at https://${your_domain}:3000.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# You WILL NOT be able to connect through http. You must prefix your URL with HTTPS.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# You will be asked to create an admin account on first visit. If you have any issues join my Discord server.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# After you have the server set up you can create other user account, or use the admin account.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# You will be able to login to your private registry using the docker client by pointing it to your domain.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# ex. docker login forestfiles.com&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# From here you can interact with your private registry to push and pull images as you would on DockerHub.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# =====!!!!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!!!!=====&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Make sure to set these values.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# If your server is on a subdomain (sub.forestfiles.com) that's fine&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# The domain must be set up with a properly configured A Record that points to the server IP.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# You cannot use an IP address with this configuration. You must have a domain name.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;DOMAIN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;forestfiles.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$DOMAIN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;forestfiles.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;then
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;you forgot to change the domain&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

				<title>How to build a monetizable web app in 60 days</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Well, 63 days if we’re going by the latest commit in the repo. But that’s close enough! Do you have any side projects? I have tons of them. I have side projects that are waiting on side-side projects for the side project that will (fingers crossed) make them even more awesome (when they’re finished (if ever)). Do you have any side projects that make money? Ah, now THAT is a much rarer sighting. I’ve personally never had a side project that was capable of generating money on its own. &lt;!-- (1) video wrapper --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;youtube-video&quot; data-embed=&quot;zAWGcx4aNZE&quot;&gt; 
 
    &lt;!-- (2) the &quot;play&quot; button --&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;play-button&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 
     
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose the Youtube channel does, but it’s nothing to write home about. Every once in a while we’re sitting at our desk thinking we could be doing something better with our time, and changing the world with code! And I’ve had that moment many times myself. I have an idea. I get started on it. It turns out to be way harder than I thought. It doesn’t just happen to individuals. It happens to companies as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the companies I’ve worked for ended up failing within two years of working there. I don’t know if that says more about my luck or my impact, but I’ve learned a lot through all of those failures. Even when peoples livelihoods depend on shit working sometimes it’s hard to get shit to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked on a few of these failures with my buddy in the quote below. One of them was a startup where we worked on a remote team together. It crashed and burned. Then we had our own idea that was going to change everything. It only changed our net worths. Negatively. That’s part of the process though. You learn from your experiences and your mistakes and you keep trying. So on Oct 8th, 2018 while working at home I get this message from my buddy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(all spelling and grammatical errors included)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;10:00 AM
I’m wracking my brain (and yours) to assemble a list of interesting and instantly monetizable problems which haven’t been worked on.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I’ve come to recognize the type of products and services I enjoy working on the most are centered around making peoples’ “daily grinds” (individually or as a community) less crappy. For example, some of the items I’ve put on my list:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;{ his list }&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I want to devote my time, energy, and creativity to a problem that can make modern life more manageable for people, even if it’s only in a small way. The idea doesn’t have to be world-changing, but it does need to be something people was consistently throw money at without a second thought if it did a great job doing what it said it would do I loved working on Daology, and want to get back to the same feeling of having a purpose…but this time I want to ensure we have a clear path to revenue and a huge pool of potential customers, first. No reason to do anything overly ambitious. I don’t care if the idea is boring-sounding, if it has an immediate and quantifiable reason to exist. Hell, I’d build a company around (literal) garbage collection and processing if I could reliably make money and improve lives while doing it.When I look at the most successful people and companies I know, the vast majority took some seemingly mundane, but prevalent pain people all over suffer through and incrementally improved it.They didn’t build the next social network, “redefined AI”, or a rocket ship…they made it easier for people like us to drop off clothes for cleaning, simplified keeping track of household finances, or designed and produced a small little elastic strap to keep your damn hair out of your eyes while working out or a ponytail neatly in place.Wow…that was a dump of early morning thoughts on you. Apologies for the actual wall of text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, that was a dump of thoughts on me at 10 am. And it took me a while to respond because initially, my answer was no. I’m burnt out from all this. I can’t deal with another unfinished or failed side project. But a lot of things have changed since the last time we worked on something together. I started to think about the whole approach differently. And eventually I replied with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;10:22 AM
yeah I don’t really have a path forward on this, but I’ve come to the conclusion that the only managble way for me to build side income in tech would be some kind of pay once service that does some specific thing. It lives on AWS lambda and only runs when someone pays for it to run. it does that one specific thing, and sends the result to the person (or does the thing). This is infinitely scalable infrastructure wise, doesn’t require ongoing support, and doesn’t require ongoing monitoring or maintenance. That’s the only thing I can think of that would work for people with limited time to commit. I don’t know what that service looks like unfortunately&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe not exactly infinitely scalable. Unfortunately, hyperbole is a superpower of mine. After this day we eventually figured out what that service looks like. What we eventually landed on isn’t going to change the world. But it is a working, complete, scalable web app that was built by two people on their spare time in 60 days. Let’s take a look at what it is, and how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SendPostMoji.com lets you send personalized emoji postcards in the mail using a simple online card creator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app consists of two git repositories. One is a GitHub Pages repo which hosts the front-end. Everything you see on SendPostMoji.com is being served directly from GitHub for free. Whenever we push a change up to the repo GitHub automatically rebuilds the Jekyll based website. So, effectively we don’t have to worry about our website going down other than the periodic GitHub Pages maintenance periods. But for a small project like this those are acceptable inconveniences to trade for having someone else deal with hosting for free. My buddy handled the vast majority of the frontend work. I helped mock content, fix some crossed wires, and finish up some features. But even for an MVP how beautiful does it look?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the impact of working with an experienced UX designer. If I find a screenshot of what I originally mocked up I’ll share it here so we can all laugh at how bad I am at design. Being able to collaborate with people that complement your strengths and weaknesses is huuuuge. I can’t emphasize enough how important it is to network and find people who like to build and tinker with things on the side. I would have never been able to produce such a result in the time span on my own. It would have probably ended up abandoned. Thankfully I didn’t have to. Collaboration is such a rewarding experience with great people. Get out there and mingle ya’ll. My deal in this arrangement was to work primarily on the backend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember we’re two people with full-time jobs. My buddy has the whole house, wife, kids, blah blah blah deal and I’m generally very lazy. So time is extremely limited for us both in somewhat different but equally valid ways. Whatever we build needs to be able to survive on its own for the most part without costing us too much. We don’t have time to be putting out fires in the middle of the night on top of our existing lives. Infrastructure is hard to manage and maintain even when you’re paid to do it. But we don’t have to worry about infrastructure where we’re going, kids! Because we’re going Serverless! With Serverless Computing! (Superman pose) I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp1SFflR2A0&quot;&gt;made a video&lt;/a&gt; not too long ago about AWS Lambda functions with the Serverless framework. Showing how to create a simple HTTP endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the video states, there’s a number of advantages to building around the compute function architecture. For one, you don’t have a server constantly running all day when in reality it only needs about 6 seconds for X to happen. X of course, can be anything. That’s your function. Like any old programming function. So what’s my function? Send a PostMoji.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you choose your PostMoji, enter the message and address, and finally pay for the postcard it fires off all that information to an AWS Lambda function. It’s a NodeJS based function using various libraries for the services we’re relying on. The function relies on several external services that handle the entire process of creating and mailing the PostMoji, charging the customer’s credit card, and mailing a notification to the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lob.com - API to create a send various types of mailing. Including letters and postcards.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stripe.com - API that handles credit card transactions securely.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SparkPost.com - API to send emails&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MailChimp.com - Mailing List manager with API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the Lambda function spins up the first thing we do is check to see if they want to be bothered by us through email sometimes. If the user ticked yes we send their email address to a mailing list on MailChimp so we can poke them later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we take the recipient address and send it through Lob’s address validation service. This lets us know if we can send a PostMoji to that address. From there we’ll create a test postcard with Lobs test API to make sure there are no issues with the postcard data entered. If there are no issues with the test postcard we finally send the real postcard - which obviously should pass by this point. When that returns successfully we attempt to charge the users credit card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can I just say for a second I love stripe? Basically, the way it works is they provide you with this awesome credit card form code that gives you an amazing credit card input. Does all of the validation and looks super jazzy. It sends the credit card info directly to stripe and then returns a transaction payload. Now you send this transaction payload to your backend for processing. The transaction payload doesn’t contain any personal information of the user or their credit card. So there’s no chance of accidentally leaking user credit card info in logs and what not. So cool. Anywho.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now finally if the payment is successful we send the user a confirmation e-mail that the PostMoji is on its way. Any exceptions met along the way are attempted to be handled gracefully. Such as if the credit card charge fails for any reason we immediately cancel the postcard order. Neato! Now you know what it is, and how it works. Why is this so fundamentally different from how we’ve approached projects and side projects before? We focused our stack and goals to work within our defined limitations. Here’s some of the key things that we identified in our final setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No active running costs. GitHub Pages is hosting our frontend for free. We have no hosting costs or servers to monitor. Nor do we need to worry about scalability in the future. The one con is we’re subject to GitHub pages maintenance downtimes. The AWS Lambda is not constantly running. It only spins up to perform its function when someone makes a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Predictable costs. Every action within our Lambda has a predictable cost. The number of emails we send, Stripe’s cut from charging the user, and the cost of postcards are all wrapped within the cost of running the lambda. We’re still using the free tier for many of the services, but we should be able to predict costs fairly accurately with our configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No infrastructure ownership. With GitHub handling the frontend and AWS handling the servers, we don’t have any alarms to monitor or resources to manage. We can sleep at night and worry about our day jobs when the sun is up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Security through isolation. Every user’s order is managed in its own isolated environment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Almost) limitless scalability. Our Lambda relies on other APIs. So really they’re our only bottleneck. I wouldn’t be surprised if AWS was hosting the APIs for all the services in the Lambda. They do big things yo. Right now the Lambda isn’t aware of rate limits, so that would need to be considered in the future. But we would need to start receiving dozens of orders per second before that becomes a cause for concern. I don’t see that happening soon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Manageable codebase. Our lambda function is only about 130 lines of code. The serverless framework adds quite a few files to the repo and you have to configure the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;serverless.yml&lt;/code&gt;. Once you have it set up it’s a breeze to manage a Serverless function. The frontend is a simple Jekyll app mostly powered by jquery. In a word of React and Vue - I know. There are only a few main files to mess around with in that repo. We also have a nice clean distinction between our backend and our frontend in two separate folders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flexibility. We’ve branded this site around emoji images after we scaled back on many ideas and iterations of what this project would be. But we can quickly substitute any other kind of branded cards in our card creator system. We could consider licensing sports team logos and set up a totally new site layout fairly fast. The lambda and frontend were built with this type of flexibility in mind, so they can quickly adapt to support other iterations without changing much code.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The projects that we tackled before had us spending so much time focusing on what hard problems we were going to solve. We would get far enough into the process to end up tangled by the tech we were using or our own limitations. This time around we started with identifying our own problems and limitations. In our case mostly having time and money to invest. Then we designed our passion project around the understanding of those limitations. So we could arrive at not only something that would be completed within a reasonable timespan but also continue to exist and potentially thrive without requiring us to helicopter over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this set up sustainable? I have no idea in all honesty. I’ve never built anything like this before. But it SOUNDS like it should be. How hard can the postcard business be? We’re going to become the Apple of emoji based postcards. Who’s in our way right now? Nobody! (I think?) I suppose with enough time and luck we’ll see. For a long time, I felt like monetizable projects needed to be game-changers. Which often left me tangled in the weeds deep in the woods. But there’s a lot of opportunities to set realistic goals within your means now more than ever. With some consideration of your architecture, goals, limitations, and collaboration it’s possible to develop a monetizable web app on a budget in 60 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We aren’t going to change the world by making it super easy for people to send emoji postcards. But we might help someone put a smile on someone else’s face. That’s pretty cool too. We have a great foundation, so from here we can continue to improve and learn from this experience over time. I would absolutely love if you could help us test this new service by sending someone you know a PostMoji, and telling us how the experience was for you. PostMoji is only available to send to USA addresses at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Help me automate my youtube channel</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I made the MrPowerScripts YouTube channel on Jan 5, 2012. Very close to seven years old! How wild is that? After making over one hundred videos my channel has 373,803+ views. It feels really great knowing I’ve helped so many people save time by scripting, programming, and developing. I’ve had so much fun with it, and I want to see it continue to grow. And this is always the challenge with growing up, right? I’m finding I have less to spend on hours and hours cutting up video. Doing in-depth research about a subject so I don’t get called out for being inaccurate in the comments. Reviewing, making the thumbnails, doing conversions and more reviews after reviews after reviews. &lt;!-- (1) video wrapper --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;youtube-video&quot; data-embed=&quot;Q7tLhrnMZVs&quot;&gt; 
 
    &lt;!-- (2) the &quot;play&quot; button --&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;play-button&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 
     
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m exhausted just thinking about all of it. I started blogging and it’s great. I love writing, and this has given me an opportunity to write more and share thoughts in a different way. But videos have always been my thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began making tech videos because I love learning from videos. Sometimes hearing someone explain something is really the key to making it click. To combine that with visuals that help illustrate the spoken ideas is an amazing opportunity for learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powershell wasn’t as very well known or popular of a tool back in 2012. I thought it was my opportunity to share how I was saving time at work and automating various tasks with scripts. I made the channel and started uploading videos about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see through the history of the channel I learned some new things over time. Switched into different kinds of subjects about tech. Started to focus a bit more on general development. Where could I possibly go next? What is my goal here? What is the end game for this channel? I’ve been asking myself that quite a bit, and I think I have an amazing answer. I want to automate the entire youtube channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, what? Automate? How? Videos don’t just fall out of the sky! You can’t just set up some sort of video collection system that catches videos from the sky and puts them through some processing facility that purifies these sky videos and bottles them to be sold at the purified sky videos mart down the street. it’s not possible! And you would be right if we were talking about sky videos. Because that’s not a thing. But we’re not. I feel like I can do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole point of the channel is to teach people how to automate things so they can get more done in less time. This is the perfect solution to my conundrum. I can continue to work on the channel but streamline the production process so that it can continue to grow in new ways. Maybe ways I don’t even expect. More on that in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is definitely not one of those overnight things, but I think the channel is in a good place for me to try something like this. I’ve been thinking about different ways to approach this. I feel like I have a fairly rough idea of what I need and where this can go. It will take baby steps and learning over time. The key thing to remember is that I won’t be able to do this on my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, first off, this is going to cost money. The channel does earn a bit of money. Around 33 dollars a month at the moment. Though I don’t think that’s going to be enough to get a video production pipeline moving. Want to help me? The laziest option is to support me &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/MrPowerScripts&quot;&gt;on my new Patreon page&lt;/a&gt;. From there you can subscribe and support me with as little as $1 a month. You’ll also get the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Supporter&lt;/code&gt; role on my new &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/uEBWZKq&quot;&gt;Discord server&lt;/a&gt; automatically. More on why that’s important later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking for more interesting ways to help me automate my YouTube channel? That’s great! Money isn’t everything. Coming to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/uEBWZKq&quot;&gt;Discord server&lt;/a&gt; with ideas, or helping to create content for videos is amazingly helpful. I really think people should be paid for their work though. I know if I want to automate a channel that makes videos it’s going to come at a cost. This might be where I have to start with this process. Become a budget Youtube production channel. I’ll be the RyanAir of youtube tech videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll have to start by spending money out of my own pocket to work with video editors, writers, and voice over artists to help put the production together. I have literally produced all of the work for the past seven years. I’ve never outsourced any of the efforts. So it would be interesting to see how working with others changes the channels feel. And I don’t mean professionals haha. No no, no way I can afford professionals right now. I mean literally anyone who will work at bargain prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe someone who is learning how to do video editing and can accomplish simple work. Maybe someone who wants to get into doing voice overs. Maybe other people like me who started by learning from youtube videos. If you have an interest in any of those things stop by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/uEBWZKq&quot;&gt;Discord server&lt;/a&gt;. At one point I aspired to learn how to do all those things myself. That would be an interesting way to get this process going. If others learned the same way I learned but were able to earn some money for their efforts as well. We’ll see if anyone manages to find this with interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Money, community, or both. Those are key to driving this idea forward. Now, remember I did say automate the channel. Meaning that the whole process starting from generation of a video idea to storyboarding to creating scenes to putting it all together for a final product that uploads itself to youtube is the goal. Really. Like full on automating everything. Now I don’t have the means to create the artificial intelligence necessary that could do all of that work for me. So I’ll still need help from other peoples brains. How sad is that? Where’s my Rosie the robot? Actually, maybe I would prefer to have a Bender around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial thought is to democratize decisions through votes. How can I possibly do that? Do you remember earlier when I said that donating to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/MrPowerScripts&quot;&gt;my Patreon&lt;/a&gt; gives you the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Supporter&lt;/code&gt; role in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/uEBWZKq&quot;&gt;Discord server&lt;/a&gt;? People with the supporter role will be able to vote on events in the video creation process. A while ago I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MrPowerScripts/battle-nation-live-discord-bot&quot;&gt;Discord bot&lt;/a&gt; that manages a Discord server as a karaoke competition. You can vote on who is performing using emoji. It’s a neat idea that never really gained traction, so I’m not exactly sure if it totally works! You can see it in action if you go to [https://BattleNationLive.com](https://battlenationlive.com].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to take this bot and modify the voting system to work for people with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Supporter&lt;/code&gt; role, so they can vote on different parts of the video creation process. Maybe on which idea for the next video. Or which voice-over artist to use. Eventually, if I find some great people to work with they can be added to submit content to be voted on as well. Imagine a script has been submitted and voted on. Now someone creates a voice-over for the scene and a separate visual for the scene. Those two elements are both voted on and approved. They can be automatically combined for everyone to preview. A process flow for building out videos can develop. It will all be very manual to start out, but once the bot and voting are in place things can become very interesting from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now people who are supporting the channel through [Patreon][https://www.patreon.com/MrPowerScripts) have a voice! Democracy is alive! There is a relationship between those supporting the channel and the direction that the channel takes. Which, means, once the pipeline is complete the channel may not even be about tech anymore. It could be about anything really. I wouldn’t have much of a say. If this idea is successful there will be enough money and decision makers available &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/MrPowerScripts&quot;&gt;through Patreon&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/uEBWZKq&quot;&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; driving the content creation process. There could be a new video every week for me to sit back and enjoy. After seven years of making them myself I think it would be nice!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>That time I created a broadband law for an entire country</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;When I was in my early 20’s I somehow ended up as the “IT Guy” at this company headquarters. This was a long time ago but I still think about it sometimes. While most of the company was out in the west coast they had a headquarters on the east where all the executives worked. Though, their IT support was entirely based on the west coast. Which left a gap in the morning for available IT support. Well, that is not the kind of service these money makers are used to! They want support, and they want it NOW. So through a series of odd events that person ended up being me. That’s where the story really starts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone in the office was so. freaking. happy. to have a techy in the building. Remember, this was an office of senior executives. There were very few people under 40 there. I was definitely the only person in their 20’s. I wasn’t just the go-to guy for technical issues within the company. I became everyone’s personal tech dude. I hate that shit and avoid it at all costs now. But at the time, I didn’t mind it. I was so excited to be able to work with many talented people and it was a great opportunity for me to learn more about them and how they got where they’re at. I really relished those opportunities. This allowed me to get to know a lot of people in the office as well. They really liked me and valued my opinions on technology and that felt really good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One morning I’m sitting in my office and the phone rings. It’s someone from the legal team and they asked me a very strange question: “How fast is broadband?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain some things about this person. They’re from South America and spent half of their time bouncing back and forth from there. They were ridiculously qualified from what I can tell. The office had a wall covered in degrees. Seriously sharp person and didn’t like bullshit. They were known for being really tough. Thankfully, I didn’t have to deal with that side of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they really trusted my advice on technical questions. I was just some random IT kid that was lucky to be there. I know that doesn’t sound like it should matter but I REALLY did not feel qualified to be working there. It was so long ago but I still think about how lucky I was to get pulled in for that project. Lot’s of people in that office made me feel really respected and it was so cool, so I didn’t want to disappoint them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us back to that early morning call I received: “How fast is broadband?”.  I wasn’t really sure why the point of the question was at the time. I remember trying to think of a suitable answer. I’m getting hit early in the morning with these philosophical questions. Yeah, how fast IS broadband? Well back then it definitely wasn’t what it would be considered now. The answer I gave at the time was “I would consider broadband to be at least 1Mbps up and down”. They were satisfied with that and said “Thanks! You just made a law!”, before letting me know they had to run and hung up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, I just what? That moment was burned into my mind for weeks and weeks until they arrived back to the office in the USA. Where I finally inquired further about the one minute call that ended with me making a law. As it turns out they were helping to craft some tech laws for a country. I can’t remember which one it was, but I think it was one of the countries in the southern region. They were deciding what the legal definition of broadband would be for the entire country. A law that would impact companies, users, and all kinds of services between for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, apparently, defined that law. You’re welcome, random South American country.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Mindfulness meditation can help you get in the flow</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Having trouble concentrating? You don’t feel as productive as you once did? Are small things getting to you? If you answered yes to any of those questions I really wish I had a pill to sell you. Really. I could be like a millionaire by now. Almost everyone I know has these problems. I’m not here to offer any medical advice though. If you have a severe ailment you should really see a doctor. If not, here’s a giant helping of opinion for ya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I notice many friends and colleagues always suffering from similar battles. Concentration, focus, drive, or even peace of mind. We live in a time where someone can press a few buttons and you’re witnessing graphic images from a disaster happening on the other side of the planet. THERE IS SO MUCH TO WORRY ABOUT! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s pretty much how it feels in this age of information. Yet you still have to wake up, do your job, and deal with all of the craziness that impacts you directly in your life. Heavy times yo. I still remember when I didn’t carry around a device that allows me to directly inject all the worlds problems right into my veins anywhere I have a data signal. It doesn’t have to be bad things. We interrupt moments of our lives all the time to be distracted by notifications from friends or through advertisements as we walk through the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we get used to these patterns of consumption on a daily basis, or the society we live in normalizes those behaviors it becomes really hard to detach.  Detaching from streams of information that don’t help us in the current moment allow us to focus and find our flow. We’re just fancy fleshy computers and we can only process so much at one time. If your head is running at 100% all the time you’re going to burn out eventually. You have to find a good flow in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t mean flow as some wishy-washy term. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)&quot;&gt;Flow is actually a studied term&lt;/a&gt; that describes a mental state where you’re at your best doing something. Let’s take a moment to enjoy some of the Wikipedia article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In any given moment, there is a great deal of information made available to each individual. Psychologists have found that one’s mind can attend to only a certain amount of information at a time. According to Csikszentmihályi’s 2004 TED talk, that number is about “110 bits of information per second”.[5] That may seem like a lot of information, but simple daily tasks take quite a lot of information. Just decoding speech takes about 60 bits of information per second.[5] That is why when having a conversation one cannot focus as much attention on other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For the most part (except for basic bodily feelings like hunger and pain, which are innate), people are able to decide what they want to focus their attention on. However, when one is in the flow state, they are completely engrossed with the one task at hand and, without making the conscious decision to do so, lose awareness of all other things: time, people, distractions, and even basic bodily needs. This occurs because all of the attention of the person in the flow state is on the task at hand; there is no more attention to be allocated.[6]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The flow state has been described by Csikszentmihályi as the “optimal experience” in that one gets to a level of high gratification from the experience.[7] Achieving this experience is considered to be personal and “depends on the ability” of the individual.[7] One’s capacity and desire to overcome challenges in order to achieve their ultimate goals not only leads to the optimal experience, but also to a sense of life satisfaction overall.[7]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are processing only what you need to process in order to do the things you need to get done. This is where greatness comes from. That is where you want to be. How do you reach new heights with this imagery focus muscle that allows you to do great things? It’s the same as every other muscle. You have to exercise it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now getting into the flow for a basketball player is certainly different from getting into the flow for a programmer. But the common denominator for any type of flow is having the ability to control your thoughts and thus allow your mind to indulge itself in the current moment. If you’re baking a cake while thinking about the cake you messed up last week you’re probably going to mess up this weeks cake as well. The current ticking moment is always the most important time in a state of flow. Don’t waste it on things that you can’t control right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do find myself in this flow state very often with certain activities. When I’m playing videos games. When I’m on the court playing basketball. At work when I’m troubleshooting problems and helping people. I’m able to take everything else and set it aside so that I can really appreciate what is happening in front of me. I feel the primary driver of achieving this for me has been practicing Mindfulness Meditation for several years now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll have an endless amount of information to read on google about mindfulness meditation, so I’m not going to dig into it much here. I’d rather just share my thoughts on it. I hear a few of these phrases whenever I mention any kind of meditation: “I can’t do it.”, or “I tried and it doesn’t work”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consider meditation a practice similar to exercise. Unless you have some confounding medical issue, then eating less and exercising more will get you in better shape. That’s how it works.  Your mind really needs the same treatment. Don’t overload it with stuff and train it to keep it in good shape as well. What I find is that “I can’t do it” usually means “I don’t want to do it”. Which is fine. You do you. And “I tried and it doesn’t work” is often more like “I did it for a week and didn’t see any results so I gave up”. Like you’re just going to walk into the gym and come out a week later looking like The Terminator. Focusing your mind is like flexing a muscle. You have to exercise it for results and it takes time to notice big changes. If you don’t find a way to exercise it you will never find your flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness meditation isn’t the only way to exercise this muscle. But it’s the only one that I’ve found to be free and available anywhere I can sit or lay down. When I practiced this long enough I started to notice many benefits throughout my days. I’m far more patient than I’ve ever been in my life. I don’t let external factors take the wheel of my emotions as often. I don’t have as many “bad days”. I have days that are more challenging than others. As someone who’s had and is still going through a rather tumultuous life, it’s a pretty big statement for me. I really believe it though. As challenging as it has been to develop this muscle I feel mindfulness meditation has taught me to better understand myself.  Through that understanding, I’ve been able to make changes that help me operate more efficiently in my daily life. This greater perception of self and strength of focus can maybe help you find your flow too.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Faster ReactJS development with Create-React-App and Heroku</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I always loved working on React projects. There was a lot of overhead getting started early on for me. I don’t even want to get into how many hours I spent learning how webpack work. Oh, there’s a new version of webpack? EVERYTHING IS DIFFERENT NOW. React isn’t that much better with breaking changes. When you combine all these various software “solutions” it can be hard to even get started with what you originally wanted to do. Code the freaking idea up. &lt;!-- (1) video wrapper --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;youtube-video&quot; data-embed=&quot;xckpWg-Kpss&quot;&gt; 
 
    &lt;!-- (2) the &quot;play&quot; button --&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;play-button&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 
     
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a long time to figure out a setup that allowed me to jump right into developing the react app and thinking less about the setup. This is what I’ve finally settled on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off Create-React-App is an amazing project that basically takes a lot of best practices of React configuration and packs it all together into a framework for building simple React apps. Is it perfect for everything? No, but for most of my projects starting with a Creat-React-App was enough to get me started. Running &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;create-react-app project-name&lt;/code&gt; would create and configure a full React development environment folder structure. It even comes bundled with a hot reloading web server so you can watch things change as you develop. I find it especially wonderful for getting new people into and learning React. Without having to worry about all the React configuration up front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building and working on apps locally is fun, but ultimately you’re going to want to show off what you’ve made. That’s where Heroku and their buildpacks come into play here. Buildpacks are Heroku libraries that automate building and deploying tasks on Heroku. There are many buildpacks for many kinds of projects. One of those kinds is create-react-app buildpacks. I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nhutphuongit/create-react-app-buildpack&quot;&gt;this one in the video&lt;/a&gt; but you might find others that you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a Heroku account and their &lt;a href=&quot;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli&quot;&gt;sweet CLI tool installed&lt;/a&gt; you can configure a buildpack on your local Create-React-App project. This will add a new &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git remote&lt;/code&gt; called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;heroku&lt;/code&gt; to your project. Want to deploy your Create-React-App to a live domain that you can share with anyone? All you have to do is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git push heroku master&lt;/code&gt; and your code will be pushed up to Heroku where the buildpack will build and optimize your Create-React-App for production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How freaking cool is that? No need to manage a server. No need to get all wrapped up in webpack. You can get a React project started up and live within ten minutes and start coding out your new idea to share with everyone. At least that has been the case for me. If you like to prototype React projects quickly I highly suggest checking out Heroku and Create-React-App.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How to make a discord bot</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Discord is probably one of my favorite apps ever. They started off with a simple idea and worked really hard to add features over time. Though the software hasn’t suffered from its rapid development and release cycles. &lt;!-- (1) video wrapper --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;youtube-video&quot; data-embed=&quot;kieSx_pzpCU&quot;&gt; 
 
    &lt;!-- (2) the &quot;play&quot; button --&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;play-button&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 
     
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of times you’ll see apps with the growth of Discord become bloated. Discord has managed to remain simple, but still has lots of power available to the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the places where Discord really shines is their API. Allowing people to interface with the Discord app programmatically. With helpful libraries like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/&quot;&gt;DiscordJS&lt;/a&gt; it’s possible to help automate many tasks that are helpful during the chatting experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not that difficult to get started with making a discord bot. I’ve created a template based on various other bot ideas I’ve seen. You can find the full example &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MrPowerScripts/simple-discord-chat-bot&quot;&gt;here on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s the main code that powers the bot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Discord&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;discord.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;./config.json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// choose the enviroment variables as config if they exist&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;DISCORD_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;DISCORD_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;discordToken&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;DISCORD_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NODE_ENV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// THIS IS THE MAGIC RIGHT HERE YA'LL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Initialize Discord Bot&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Discord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// don't talk to other bots&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  
      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Also good practice to ignore any message that does not start with our prefix, &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// which is set in the configuration file.&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;indexOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// parse the chat message to get the command that was run&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;substring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cmd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;splice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cmd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// check to see if the bot is alive&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;ping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;reply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;pong&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;discordToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;SIGINT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really not that much. The video goes into detail explaining all of the working parts. It also shows in real time that with the template repo you can get your bot running in less than 5 minutes. How awesome is that? Pretty awesome I would say.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How to use git version control</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;When I first started scripting, my development flow went something like this: Create a script and save it as a file. Make some adjustments I want to test and save it in a new file. Make more adjustments and save it as a new file. Rinse, repeat. I would end up with a folder full of different file versions with different names that all were effectively the same script. &lt;!-- (1) video wrapper --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;youtube-video&quot; data-embed=&quot;NwQ0M-pyeHQ&quot;&gt; 
 
    &lt;!-- (2) the &quot;play&quot; button --&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;play-button&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 
     
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re doing things this way then STOP. Watch the video above and save yourself. After learning to use git I was vastly more effective in terms of speed and organization of my code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first encountered git when I join a remote development team. Many people were working on the same code base and my existing practices definitely weren’t viable. They taught me how to use git in my first few weeks. It was a huge challenge. There are so many commands and weird words I’d never used in the process of developing. What is a branch? What the heck does master mean? What’s the point of a SHA? It all seemed really daunting for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized after some time that git is one of those tools where 99% of the time you’ll use 1% of the features it offers. Even that small portion is enough to completely revamp the way you manage your code. Once you have the basics down you can really appreciate some of the more advanced toolings that are available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git bisect&lt;/code&gt; is a great example of this. By breaking all of your code changes into individual orderly commits it helps maintain a clear stream of changes to your code. If many people are working on the same codebase and making lots of changes it can be difficult to figure out when a change was introduced that broke something. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git bisect&lt;/code&gt; is a command that helps you traverse all of the changes to the code very efficiently to identify the precise commit that introduced the change. Even if you’re not familiar with the code or someone else introduced the breaking change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern development is possible because of version control systems, and I think git is a really great place to start for anyone who wants to become a modern developer.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Send GET requests to API with Powershell</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;When I started learning Powershell web technologies were mostly a mystery for me. I was a simple systems admin trying to make my life easier by automating things. Sure, I knew how to create a basic HTML site with some CSS, but even javascript was well beyond my understanding. Though over time I developed an interest in developing for the web, which spurred me to learn how Powershell can interact with things beyond my computer or local network. &lt;!-- (1) video wrapper --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;youtube-video&quot; data-embed=&quot;7mEmQgGowMY&quot;&gt; 
 
    &lt;!-- (2) the &quot;play&quot; button --&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;play-button&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 
     
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I scrape a website with Powershell? How can I access an API? How can I send data from my computer to services on the web? I had so many questions for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- (1) video wrapper --&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;youtube-video&quot; data-embed=&quot;9piyM38it_8&quot;&gt; 
 
    &lt;!-- (2) the &quot;play&quot; button --&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;play-button&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 
     
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered the concept of an API and found it absolutely amazing. Having a standard way for different computers with different operating systems running different programs build with different code sounded so cool. I don’t need a browser to interact with this website? That’s amazing! Think of all the automation possibilities!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I found out about RESTful or a REST API design. Through the process of learning about REST APIs, I discovered the JSON data format. As someone who had to work a lot with verbose XML files for configuration data and data transfer, it looked like an amazing alternative.  Once I learned a bit more about what a REST API is and how to format data as JSON it opened up this new world of communicating with other systems through the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to use Invoke-WebRequest in Powershell to GET or POST data from various API resources. I looked around for all kinds of APIs on the internet to see what I could do with them. That encouraged me to learn how to make my own API interfaces. Which I eventually managed to do using tools like Flask with Python and ExpressJS with NodeJS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Powershell cmdlet Invoke-WebRequest automatically turned JSON objects from GET requests into Powershell Objects which made it super easy to inspect and play around with the data from the command line. Making it super easy to test and play around with the data I was passing through the APIs I made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, request tools like Postman and Insomnia became popular, and I generally steered away from using Windows while developing. When all of my web work started though Powershell was there to help me along, and I still think it’s a really great tool for quickly scripting and working with data at the command line. Objects are awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve linked above the two videos I made about using Invoke-WebRequest to make Get and Post requests. Those two are all you need to get started with the fun world of APIs and web automation with Powershell. Happy scripting!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Automate Installing IP Printers With Powershell</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite ways of saving time as a systems administrator was automating the installation of printers. You don’t need Powershell for it. I often times did with simple batch scripts. PowerShell is all the rage in the world of Windows these days, so that’s why the video examples use it. &lt;!-- (1) video wrapper --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;youtube-video&quot; data-embed=&quot;E2x6NG72tn4&quot;&gt; 
 
    &lt;!-- (2) the &quot;play&quot; button --&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;play-button&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 
     
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning how to automate printer installations really saved me a lot of time in previous jobs, but it wasn’t always easy changing a culture of manual effort. Sometimes you have to wait for the right opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was working at a commercial bank as a customer support slash junior systems admin for the company. Their support team didn’t automate anything. I had previously come from work cultures where we did our very best to automate ourselves out of a job. It was frustrating, but I saw an awesome opportunity to make the lives of my team easier and improve the support experience. There was one problem with my plan. Nobody wanted to change their ways. Wait, what? This is CLEARLY a better way of doing things? How could they not embrace this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to let it go for a long time. We continued to manually VNC into peoples computers if they needed a printer to be (re)installed. I hated it. so. much. The tides turned when a big office project came into focus. We needed to rename all of the network printer names and IP addresse for all the printers in the office. Two giant floors of people needed all the printers on their computers updated to use the new naming conventions. We were instructed to do this by hand for each user in the office as the printer names and IP addresses were updated. There were so many frustrating questions that ran through my head which had no great answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How the hell are we supposed to know which users will be impacted by the change? There was no way to tell who had what installed on their machines. We were supposed to make assumptions. How long is it going to take to update each person’s machine? Some people had four or five printers installed. I would have to go back and forth referencing a document to install the printers for every single person. That is a significant disruption in the users workday, and collectively, a huge pain in the ass for me and my team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the first-day interrupting people before I decided to write up a script that would do all this work for us. I initially received a lot of pushback against it. A senior colleague on the team instructed me not to use it when I showed him because it hadn’t been approved by management. So, I went to our manager. He was also initially against the idea. He said no when I showed him what it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so upset. I went back to my desk dejected getting ready to interrupt more peoples day. “uh, how long is this going to take?”. “Can you do it after I leave?”. No, I want to get out of here at 5 pm as well Brad. I guess our manager saw the light in the end. I’m not sure what changed his mind but he later came to me and asked if I thought it was ready to be used in live action. Hell yeah, it’s automation time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script was simple. We had an excel document that had the old computer names and their new name/IP combo. I took that data and embedded it within a PowerShell script. When you ran the script it would check to see if you had any of the old names on your computer. If it found an old name it would uninstall it and then install the corresponding new name/IP. Combined with a batch script sitting on a file server it was possible to click a link in an email to run the script and update all of the computers on that computer. It generated a little report on the computer so we could inspect what happened if someone reported issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This changed the whole game. This was a project that was expected to take over a week. It would have taken many hours of productivity away from our team and others in the company. In the end, we were able to send out an email with a link to click and users could attempt the conversion at their convenience. How beautiful is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t the first time I tried to change “how we do things here”, but it was one of the most satisfying. I was given significant freedom to script solutions to daily problems after that. People would come to me asking if scripting some problem was possible. It encouraged others on the team to take some classes on PowerShell, and think differently about how we solve problems in the office. Watching the culture change was wonderful. I enjoyed working there a lot more after that. It might not always be the right time to change things, but you can always keep your eyes open for those opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
