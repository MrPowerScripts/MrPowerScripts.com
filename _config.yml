  MrPowerScripts is here to help you automate your life so you have more time for automating your life. 
  My youtube channel started as a way for me to share stuff I was learning about Powershell. That was in 2012, and 
  since then the channel and grown in many different ways as my career and skills have envolved. My new goal with the channel
  is to try and automate it entirely. I'll be sharing a lot about that journey of automation while continuing 
  other porjects and sharing them here on my blog as well as youtube. Join my on Discord if you have any questions.
