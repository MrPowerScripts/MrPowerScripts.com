    <p>Microsoft’s Ergonomic Wireless Keyboard, nicknamed the Sculpt, is a sleek, new keyboard that aims to save both your wrists and your wallet. Microsoft tuned in to grumblings about their former keyboards in the course of recent years, particularly throughout the recent years since the Natural’s introduction. The addition of a full numpad on the Natural was a noteworthy ergonomic infringement, as it forced customers to full extend their arms to reach their mice. Learning from this mistake, the Sculpt has a unattached numpad, enabling the mouse to be nearer to the keyboard.

<h2 id="the-ergonomic-champion">The Ergonomic Champion</h2>

<p>The loathed single-piece space key of the Natural is gone also. The Sculpt utilizes a split space key, which really fires each time it’s hit – as of now a noteworthy improvement. The remainder of the keys are level and chiclet style, like what you’d find on a PC’s keyboard. They utilize scissor switches, which are bouncier and more “clicky” (far from a feel, rather a sound; Sculpt keys are moderately silent) than those of the Natural. It was an incredibly well-planned decision – the Sculpt has an unquestionably quick response time and has a greatly improved the responsiveness of each key.</p>

<p>Regrettably, not all the keys are made like the Sculpt’s space key. The function keys are closer to buttons, which require more strain to activate. Also, rather than a flip or toggle key for secondary functions (volume, stop/play and so forth), Microsoft chose to utilize a switch on the upper right corner. Users who utilize the toggled function keys wouldn’t fret, however any individual who needs to utilize both will – software engineers specifically have complained.</p>

<iframe style="width:120px;height:240px;" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;OneJS=1&amp;Operation=GetAdHtml&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;source=ss&amp;ref=as_ss_li_til&amp;ad_type=product_link&amp;tracking_id=mrpowerscript-20&amp;language=en_US&amp;marketplace=amazon&amp;region=US&amp;placement=B00CYX26BC&amp;asins=B00CYX26BC&amp;linkId=0580672fd24de145635e7d260efe4ce4&amp;show_border=true&amp;link_opens_in_new_window=true"></iframe>

<p>The Sculpt’s mouse has come under fire from Amazon commentators, however I observed it to be an incredible item, though with a few provisos. An arch shape makes it fit pleasantly in the hand, and once when you’re to it, the thumb channel makes it exceptionally evident how it is meant to be held. Be that as it may, clients with bigger hands may discover the mouse to be undersized. Microsoft hasn’t demonstrated much love to the lefties, who will need to connect an extra mouse. In any case, I liked that both the mouse and the keyboard (and an unattached numpad) were all connected to a common remote dongle, which conveniently stores inside a compartment in the mouse. The shaping of the Sculpt’s mouse has been well – it is held with a grip that can only be described as a mix between that of a normal mouse and a vertical mouse; it makes for an agreeable, ergonomic gadget, and one that is a lot simpler to adjust to than its vertical-oriented alternatives. Obviously, left-handed individuals and customers who require more customization should search somewhere else for their mouse needs.</p>

<p>All in all, one of the greatest setbacks for the Sculpt is the absence of customizability. While the keyboard is well-structured and appealing, a few customers may discover bits of it, especially the mouse, inappropriately constructed for ergonomic use. Additionally, the fixed-edge configuration makes it hard for larger users to keep their arms near them while typing. While there’s no uncertainty that the Sculpt is a superb keyboard, correct arm spacing is critical for any high usage customers.</p>

<h2 id="pros">Pro’s</h2>

<p>Microsoft’s sculpt ergonomic keyboard is wireless, meaning there is no hassle with cords. In addition, you can work from any distance from your computer and still work comfortably.
Low to no risk of carpel tunnel. The Sculpt’s ergonomic design lessens the strain on your wrists, lowering the risk of carpel tunnel. If you have any wrist pain, this is the keyboard for you.
The separate number pad allows for a “calculator-like feel” when entering numbers.
The Sculpt’s keyboard rising feature allows you to comfortably position the keyboard to allow your arms and wrists to rest.</p>

<h2 id="cons">Con’s</h2>

<p>This keyboard is unique. That means it takes a lot of time to get used to. Within the first few days of use, it is hard to grasp the layout of the keys. The Sculpt’s design takes time to get used to, but it is still very intuitive.
Adjusting the Sculpt for optimal comfort also takes time. With many features in the comfortability category, you will have to adjust the keyboard risers, the distance between the keyboard to the computer, the distance between the mouse and the keyboard, and other small adjustments to make sure that the Sculpt conforms to your wrists and arms.
The sculpt is destined to confuse your co-workers and friends. If you plan on sharing the Sculpt with your friends, family, or colleagues: don’t. Unless you are gifting them the keyboard, they will have a very hard time getting used to it, and they will likely change the layout of your keyboard. Finally have the keyboard riser set to the perfect height? Allowing a co-worker to use the keyboard will ensure that you never find that perfect height again.</p>

<p>Reviews can tell you most everything you need to know about a product. The Microsoft Sculp is no different. Let’s hear what some Sculpt owners have to say.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I have been using this keyboard for a while now, and it has helped my should problems SO MUCH. In fact, they are gone! I had completely forgotten how much my shoulder bothered me on other keyboards until I had to use my husband’s one day. It’s ergonomic, but the numeric keypad is attached, which makes using the mouse a literal pain in the neck. Using this one, with the numeric keypad separate, has completely taken care of the problem! YIPPEEEEEE!” – K. D.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I have two of these keyboards, one for work and one for home. The ergonomic positioning enables you to stretch out your hands and relax. This Microsoft design is lightweight, portable and very sleek. I put my feet up and type with the keyboard in my lap or sit on my couch and type away. Nice range and haven’t had batter issues.” – Rich</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The keyboard is fantastic, and I like how the number pad is separate from the keyboard so that it has a smaller form factor. The keyboard has a support at the front to raise it up to make it easier on your wrists. This works great when I place the keyboard on my lap and makes typing much more comfortable. It, and all of the battery compartments, are connected via magnets, which is awesome because it eliminates the possibility of it breaking off if removed multiple times. I sit 5 to 6 feet away from my computer, so having a wireless keyboard that has a good range is important, so I am happy to report that it works great at that distance. I highly recommend this keyboard for anyone who wants a wireless keyboard they can use comfortably on their lap and/or anyone who wants a good ergonomic keyboard.” - Krohgster</p>

<p>With reviews like these, you can be confident that the Microsoft Sculpt is the right fit for you and your wrists.</p>
