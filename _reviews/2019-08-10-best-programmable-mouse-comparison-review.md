Coming in first place for my under $50 category is the [***Razer DeathAdder Elite***](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-DeathAdder-Elite-Mechanical-Ergonomic/dp/B01LXC1QL0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1546945181&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=razer+deathadder+elite&amp;&amp;ascsub&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=742bcec9a2de6e29c7edfb192ac6ac35&language=en_US). Complete with 7 programmable buttons, 16,000 DPI sensor, customizable RGB colored lights, durable mechanical switches, a two-year warranty, a ridged and rubberized scroll wheel, and complex macro capabilities, the [***Razer DeathAdder Elite***](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-DeathAdder-Elite-Mechanical-Ergonomic/dp/B01LXC1QL0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1546945181&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=razer+deathadder+elite&amp;&amp;ascsub&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=742bcec9a2de6e29c7edfb192ac6ac35&language=en_US) is perfect for those with a low budget.

The Razer DeathAdder Elite has so many great features, a low price, and a high-quality build, so why would it only receive a 7.5/10?  The Razer DeathAdder Elite is riddled with what some customers called a “surrender of your privacy” and “mandatory bloatware”. The [***Razer DeathAdder Elite***](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-DeathAdder-Elite-Mechanical-Ergonomic/dp/B01LXC1QL0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1546945181&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=razer+deathadder+elite&amp;&amp;ascsub&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=742bcec9a2de6e29c7edfb192ac6ac35&language=en_US) requires you to download Razer’s software to edit the RGB lights, change the buttons’ bindings, and sync the mouse with your computer. In addition, Razer requires you to register an account and allow Razer to send diagnostic information from your mouse to their servers. If you can ignore the software and account creation that the [***Razer DeathAdder Elite***](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-DeathAdder-Elite-Mechanical-Ergonomic/dp/B01LXC1QL0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1546945181&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=razer+deathadder+elite&amp;&amp;ascsub&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=742bcec9a2de6e29c7edfb192ac6ac35&language=en_US) requires, it is an amazing mouse at a low price point. I would consider the [***Razer DeathAdder Elite***](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-DeathAdder-Elite-Mechanical-Ergonomic/dp/B01LXC1QL0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1546945181&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=razer+deathadder+elite&amp;&amp;ascsub&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=742bcec9a2de6e29c7edfb192ac6ac35&language=en_US) to be the finest low-cost mouse on the market for 2019, and if you are on a budget, it is a great choice with many unique features.

## Best Mid-Range Price Mouse

### The Razer Naga Trinity

<iframe style="width:120px;height:240px;" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&OneJS=1&Operation=GetAdHtml&MarketPlace=US&source=ss&ref=as_ss_li_til&ad_type=product_link&tracking_id=mrpowerscript-20&language=en_US&marketplace=amazon&region=US&placement=B0788MCRGC&asins=B0788MCRGC&linkId=7d4f1a88bc2db86be0f99406d48caf96&show_border=true&link_opens_in_new_window=true"></iframe>

| **Price:** $71.95 | **Programmable Buttons:** 21 |

| **Amazon Rating:** ★★★★☆ | **My Rating:** 8/10 |

Although it may seem as though I am sponsored by Razer, here’s an obligatory I am not sponsored by Razer in any way. Coming in at first place for mid-priced mice, the [***Razer Naga Trinity***](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Naga-Trinity-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B0788MCRGC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?psc=1&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIPHVZTVH6LZ5BFZA&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;ascsub&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=eeba8c998cfa1d1bbd43c592edb3bf22&language=en_US) is a great selection for anyone that needs flexibility and comfort. The [***Razer Naga***](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Naga-Trinity-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B0788MCRGC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?psc=1&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIPHVZTVH6LZ5BFZA&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;ascsub&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=eeba8c998cfa1d1bbd43c592edb3bf22&language=en_US) comes equipped with three different side panels, each with a different button layout. All three side plates carry a unique experience and can be helpful in different situations. For someone that needs a lot of customization, there is a 12-button side plate. For those who need customizable buttons often, but do not want the clutter of the 12-button plate, the [***Razer Naga***](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Naga-Trinity-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B0788MCRGC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?psc=1&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIPHVZTVH6LZ5BFZA&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;ascsub&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=eeba8c998cfa1d1bbd43c592edb3bf22&language=en_US) comes with a nine-button plate. Finally, for those who want a bit of customization, the Naga has a two-button panel. 

Unlike the [***Razer DeathAdder Elite***](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-DeathAdder-Elite-Mechanical-Ergonomic/dp/B01LXC1QL0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1546945181&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=razer+deathadder+elite&amp;&amp;ascsub&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=742bcec9a2de6e29c7edfb192ac6ac35&language=en_US) that I previously mentioned, the [***Razer Naga***](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Naga-Trinity-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B0788MCRGC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?psc=1&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIPHVZTVH6LZ5BFZA&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;ascsub&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=eeba8c998cfa1d1bbd43c592edb3bf22&language=en_US) does not require you to send them diagnostics or make an account with them. Just like the previous mouse though, the [***Razer Naga***](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Naga-Trinity-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B0788MCRGC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?psc=1&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIPHVZTVH6LZ5BFZA&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;ascsub&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=eeba8c998cfa1d1bbd43c592edb3bf22&language=en_US) is equipped with a 16,000 DPI sensor, durable mechanical switches, a rigid and rubberized scroll wheel, and customizable RGB lights. What really sets the [***Razer Naga***](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Naga-Trinity-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B0788MCRGC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?psc=1&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIPHVZTVH6LZ5BFZA&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;ascsub&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=eeba8c998cfa1d1bbd43c592edb3bf22&language=en_US) apart from the [***DeathAdder Elite***](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-DeathAdder-Elite-Mechanical-Ergonomic/dp/B01LXC1QL0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1546945181&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=razer+deathadder+elite&amp;&amp;ascsub&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=742bcec9a2de6e29c7edfb192ac6ac35&language=en_US) is the Naga’s bulk. The [***DeathAdder Elite***](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-DeathAdder-Elite-Mechanical-Ergonomic/dp/B01LXC1QL0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1546945181&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=razer+deathadder+elite&amp;&amp;ascsub&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=742bcec9a2de6e29c7edfb192ac6ac35&language=en_US) is low-profile mouse, while the Naga is quite hefty. 

The Naga is extremely comfortable in the hand, and its thickness allows you to rest your hand very comfortably on the mouse. If you worry about hand or wrist strain, the Naga is a very ergonomic and pleasantly designed mouse that will effectively cushion your hand and wrist. 

With all this raving about the Naga, what’s its setback? The Razer Naga has one main issue that has forced me to give it an 8/10 and that is its sticky buttons. Customers have complained that after heavy usage, the Naga’s buttons begin to stick. Although there is a quick fix for this (just taking out the side panel and putting it back in), this issue is still something to be aware of. Although only a few customers have complained about this issue, it is worthy of note because sticky buttons can be the bane of a heavy macro user’s existence. Overall, the [***Razer Naga***](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Naga-Trinity-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B0788MCRGC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?psc=1&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIPHVZTVH6LZ5BFZA&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;ascsub&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=eeba8c998cfa1d1bbd43c592edb3bf22&language=en_US) has many great features, and only one flaw, so I believe it is worthy of the top spot for mid-priced mice.

## Best High-End Gaming Mouse

### The Logitech G502

<iframe style="width:120px;height:240px;" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&OneJS=1&Operation=GetAdHtml&MarketPlace=US&source=ss&ref=as_ss_li_til&ad_type=product_link&tracking_id=mrpowerscript-20&language=en_US&marketplace=amazon&region=US&placement=B07L4BM851&asins=B07L4BM851&linkId=e5a9dfa710b3dd2975f1295ee762c791&show_border=true&link_opens_in_new_window=true"></iframe>

| **Price:** $149.99 | **Programmable Buttons:** 11 |

| **Amazon Rating:** ★★★★☆ | **My Rating:** 7.5/10 |

Taking first place in my high-end gaming mice category, The [***Logitech G502***](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lightspeed-PowerPlay-Compatible-Lightsync/dp/B07L4BM851/ref=as_li_ss_tl?SubscriptionId=AKIAIPHVZTVH6LZ5BFZA&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;ascsub&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=c11cf1ad5878e4eb4dd58f7e62af9b8b&language=en_US) is the perfect choice for heavier macro and button users such as programmers, gamers, and video-editors. The [***Logitech G502***](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lightspeed-PowerPlay-Compatible-Lightsync/dp/B07L4BM851/ref=as_li_ss_tl?SubscriptionId=AKIAIPHVZTVH6LZ5BFZA&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;ascsub&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=c11cf1ad5878e4eb4dd58f7e62af9b8b&language=en_US) is equipped with a 16,000 DPI sensor, 11 customizable buttons, customizable RGB lighting, lightning fast wireless capabilities, and a plastic neutral certification that lets you know that you’re saving the planet. 

Since I am mostly focusing on the programmable options in this review, I want to first talk about the G502’s programmable buttons. The G502 is equipped with 11 buttons, all of which rest firmly outside of the mouse. This makes the G502’s buttons extremely easy to locate and press. Although the buttons are raised off the mouse, they are extremely easy to press and are very responsive. The G502 also comes with amazing software which makes it extremely easy to program and set macros for each button. Logitech’s mouse software is extremely intuitive and allows the user to program macros into each button that most mice cannot perform. The [***Logitech G502***](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lightspeed-PowerPlay-Compatible-Lightsync/dp/B07L4BM851/ref=as_li_ss_tl?SubscriptionId=AKIAIPHVZTVH6LZ5BFZA&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;ascsub&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=c11cf1ad5878e4eb4dd58f7e62af9b8b&language=en_US) is very ergonomic, and its lengthier build allows the user to comfortably stretch their hand over the mouse. Just like the [***Razer Naga***](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Naga-Trinity-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B0788MCRGC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?psc=1&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIPHVZTVH6LZ5BFZA&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;ascsub&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=eeba8c998cfa1d1bbd43c592edb3bf22&language=en_US), the G502 can help prevent hand and wrist strain. Another great feature of the G502 is Logitech’s plastic neutral certification. Whether you do or don’t care about plastic production, it is nice to know that Logitech funds ocean plastic recycling with every purchase of a [***Logitech G502***](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lightspeed-PowerPlay-Compatible-Lightsync/dp/B07L4BM851/ref=as_li_ss_tl?SubscriptionId=AKIAIPHVZTVH6LZ5BFZA&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;ascsub&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=c11cf1ad5878e4eb4dd58f7e62af9b8b&language=en_US). 

Finally, my favorite feature of the G502 is its tunable weights. If you have never had a mouse with tunable weights, do yourself a favor and purchase the G502 immediately. Tunable weights allow the user to adjust the mouse’s balance and resistance. You can use the weights to adjust how the mouse feels in the hand as well as the sensitivity and responsiveness of the mouse. Throwing some weights in the mouse not only makes it more comfortable but also more accurate. Tunable weights take the G502 to the next level, and that is why I believe it is the top higher priced mouse for 2019. What makes the G502 a 9/10 vs a 10/10? The G502 has one main issue, which many would just consider a preference. Although some people enjoy the ease of use that comes with a wireless mouse, at the end of the day, it results in the mouse being slower. Although it does not make a large difference, the responsiveness of a wired versus a wireless mouse is noticeable to me, and that is why I must rate the G502 a 9/10. If you can overlook its lack of a wire, the [***Logitech G502***](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lightspeed-PowerPlay-Compatible-Lightsync/dp/B07L4BM851/ref=as_li_ss_tl?SubscriptionId=AKIAIPHVZTVH6LZ5BFZA&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;ascsub&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=c11cf1ad5878e4eb4dd58f7e62af9b8b&language=en_US) is the perfect mouse for anyone with a larger budget.
