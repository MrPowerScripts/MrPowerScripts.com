description-long: The Nest Learning Thermostat has become a symbol of the surprising level of convenience that smart home systems can bring to our daily lives; the temperature in our homes can be controlled with the touch of a button, from work or home. The first edition of the Nest was released in 2011, followed by the 2nd and 3rd editions in 2013 and 2015 respectively. The third generation Nest is the newest model and, though it has its fair share of problems, it has proven to be a great addition to any smart home system with its simple interface, unassuming appearance, and customizable controls.

The [Nest Learning Thermostat](https://www.amazon.com/Nest-T3007ES-Thermostat-Temperature-Generation/dp/B0131RG6VK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=The+Nest+Learning+Thermostat&qid=1565287838&s=gateway&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=9f05aeae9a2639a03fb4f60acc11cd27&language=en_US) has become a symbol of the surprising level of convenience that smart home systems can bring to our daily lives; the temperature in our homes can be controlled with the touch of a button, from work or home. The first edition of the Nest was released in 2011, followed by the 2nd and 3rd editions in 2013 and 2015 respectively. The third generation Nest is the newest model and, though it has its fair share of problems, it has proven to be a great addition to any smart home system with its simple interface, unassuming appearance, and customizable controls.

The *Nest* boasts an overall rating of 4.2 stars on Amazon. At a visual level, users seem to be impressed with the design of the device; it's sleek, modern, and versatile. With seven different color options - all of which complement the trendy look of the Nest with a simple, minimalist color palate - this thermostat could look just as good in a New York City penthouse as in a Kentucky farmhouse.  Whether bronze, white, black, or stainless steel fits your home and your personality, Nest provides enough options for almost everyone's style to be represented.

Installing the device also seems to come easy for many users. The *Nest* is designed to have a painless installation process, and it shows; not only does the thermostat come with a detailed instruction manual, it also includes many of the tools needed to put it together, including a screwdriver and mounting plate. These small, thoughtful additions can make a huge difference for those without toolboxes or those who are inexperienced with putting together technological devices like the *Nest*.

For those who choose not to use smart home systems because they find them too complicated, Nest may provide a breath of fresh air; the interface on this device is designed to be both straightforward and effective. There are only a few options on the home screen, but all are clearly labeled and do what you would expect of them; for example, selecting the leaf icon will turn on the Eco feature. Users seem to be pleased with the accessibility of this little thermostat. This accessibility differentiates this product from other smart home devices; a common complaint about smart home systems is that they are too hard to understand and use.

The *Nest*'s clean interface is reinforced and enhanced with the accompanying app; through the Nest app, users can control their device from work or even from their couch. Users praise this product for the "Home/Away Assist" feature; the thermostat automatically detects when the owner of the device is at home or away and adjusts the thermostat accordingly. Temperatures are customizable and there are several different pre-set modes. Users can even monitor their energy usage over time and see expected energy costs for the month. There's a lot to love as it comes to the functionality of the Nest, especially when it is paired with the app.

Though most customers are satisfied with their smart thermostats, some users have experienced critical issues with their device. Reports of the *Nest* thermostat going out completely after only a year or two years are not uncommon; on top of issues with the thermostat randomly going out, users also seem to experienced problems with the device going out when temperatures are particularly hot or cold. This is a serious fault, as the thermostat going out on the coldest or hottest days of the year renders it almost completely useless when users need it most.

Furthermore, though the Nest's ability to learn its owners' usage habits is useful and convenient to many, some users think that the device is too smart for their AC and heating systems. It seems to have an issue with changing temperatures erratically and heating up or cooling down a room drastically when it is actually unnecessary. Though the Nest claims to be an energy saver, problems like this (especially if recurring) could run up an electric bill quickly. Rooms suddenly getting hot or cold can also be simply uncomfortable and frustrating for owners; after all, what is the point of buying a smart thermostat if you have to constantly correct it?
 
Lastly, the Nest has some compatibility issues. While it is surprisingly easy to install for those with newer AC and heating systems, many of those with older homes have stated that the Nest is incredibly hard to install or is not compatible with their systems at all. This isn't clearly stated anywhere in advertising or even in product descriptions, so those interested in buying the Nest should definitely do their research on if they can use the product with their AC or heating system.

### Conclusion

The [Nest Learning Thermostat](https://www.amazon.com/Nest-T3007ES-Thermostat-Temperature-Generation/dp/B0131RG6VK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=The+Nest+Learning+Thermostat&qid=1565287838&s=gateway&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=9f05aeae9a2639a03fb4f60acc11cd27&language=en_US), though popular, is not a flawless product. Users have frequently run into issues involving a lack of longevity, reliability, and compatibility. Sometimes the thermostat seems to have a mind of its own; this can cause discomfort at best and sky-high electric bills at worst. Other users are unable to connect their thermostat at all. Despite these problems, Nest maintains strong reviews on Amazon; users love the thermostat for its polished look, painless installation, and intuitive interface. It is easy to install and even easier to use, something that can't be said of many smart devices. For many, the [Nest Learning Thermostat](https://www.amazon.com/Nest-T3007ES-Thermostat-Temperature-Generation/dp/B0131RG6VK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=The+Nest+Learning+Thermostat&qid=1565287838&s=gateway&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=9f05aeae9a2639a03fb4f60acc11cd27&language=en_US) is a perfect addition to an existing smart home system or a fun, easy start to a new one.
