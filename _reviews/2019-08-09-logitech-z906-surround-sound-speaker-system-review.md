Whether you are a film or a music lover, being able to hear your favorite track at its best quality is a must.
Luckily for us, technology has evolved enough in the recent years to reward us with the perfect solution: **surround systems**. Without them, recreating the full gamut of sound we can find in modern movies or songs is near to impossible. So, to enjoy the entire audio experience, surround systems differentiate from regular stereo players by adding more speakers, as well as subwoofers that reproduce very low-frequency sounds.
The one I will be reviewing today is the [*Logitech Z906 5.1 Surround Sound Speaker System*](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Surround-Sound-Speaker-System/dp/B004M18O60/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=2b1ca98aba4f41506c2f034d357ecb85&language=en_US).

For this model, reviews have been overall positive. The quality of the sound has been praised, and the subwoofer is said to provide a very powerful bass despite its compact size, able to reach high volumes without distortion.

Regarding the quality of the sound, some have complained that the bass might sound flat with lower volumes. Others have added that the voices are very clear in the center channel.
The design has been a controversial topic, since most have said that it presents a very simple design—“similar to that of a computer speaker”—while others have expressed support towards the compact and discreet look. Some have commented that the construction of the subwoofer is very sturdy, but that the plastic housing that makes up the satellite is not very strong. Others have added that they prefer the smaller footprint, as it takes up less space. This also makes it easier for them to be wall-mount, aided by the additional M6 mount receptacle they come with.
On this topic, another important matter is the placement of the speakers. As with any other surround system, you have to be mindful of where you place them, as each speaker plays a very particular role in the quality of the sound.

For the [*Logitech Z906 5.1*](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Surround-Sound-Speaker-System/dp/B004M18O60/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=2b1ca98aba4f41506c2f034d357ecb85&language=en_US), the 5 in the name means it comes with 5 satellite speakers, while the 1 indicates the additional subwoofer that will enhance the depth of the sound.

In order to take advantage of everything this model has to offer, the ideal placement would have the center channel placed on front, since this speaker is considered to be the most important, as it delivers about 50% of a movie’s soundtrack and dialogue.

As for the other four surround speakers, the placement depends on the size of the room but most agree that the most effective option is to place them to the left and right of the room, while facing the center. It’s been commented that they sound better if placed at ear level on the walls. For the subwoofer, something to consider is that it has a built-in amplifier and decoder, so the system doesn’t need an additional receiver. However, this means that the it must be placed near your other devices since the input source must reach its back. Placing the subwoofer near the center channel or the TV would be ideal.

Some complains included the wiring, which is apparently flimsy and not solidly built. The system can be connected in several different ways, and that’s why it comes with a large variety of cables and connectors (3.5 mm, RCA cables, 6 channel direct, 2 optical digital slots, coaxial digital). However, the quality seems to be not the best, and some have opted by replacing them with better wires.
The remote control has been also mentioned to be a great addition. With it, it is possible to adjust each pair of satellite speakers (you can adjust them from the control unit, as well). This allows you to increase or decrease the base, center channel, front left and right channels and rear channels independently relative to the rest. There is also a general volume control that increases all channels at a time.

If you are installing these speakers for the first time, you should also notice that the [*Logitech Z906*](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Surround-Sound-Speaker-System/dp/B004M18O60/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=2b1ca98aba4f41506c2f034d357ecb85&language=en_US) controller has a built-in pink test. This foregoes the need to download a pink 5.1 audio test file off the web. To use it, you only have to turn on the system and simply hold down the ‘input’ button for 5 seconds. After this, the controller will go into test mode and generate a tone for all five channels in the following order: left front, center, right front, right rear, left rear, and subwoofer. This will allow you to make sure you connected the speakers correctly, and that they are all working. A great aid for those who never used or connected a surround system before.

### Conclusion

Despite some customers complaining about defective products, the biggest part of users has commented that this surround system surpassed their expectative. The subwoofer is said to be extremely strong and able to reach amazingly low frequencies, with the satellite speakers showing more than decent quality.
All-in-all, the [*Logitech Z906*](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Surround-Sound-Speaker-System/dp/B004M18O60/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=2b1ca98aba4f41506c2f034d357ecb85&language=en_US) is said to deliver stunning sound quality at an extremely affordable price point. Reaching an astounding 4.5 stars on Amazon, if you’re looking for a great speaker system for a decent price this one can surely be one of the best options.
