The [***Acer Aspire 5***](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RF2123Z/ref=as_li_ss_tl?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-top-3&pf_rd_r=TC27QR8J79JQEXEHC0MD&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=6814c7b9-5072-4a55-95fd-923eea987e8d&pf_rd_i=12691228011&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=53402d62ff3154dc12450f6856f4905a&language=en_US) Slim also comes with a fingerprint reader, which makes it quite helpful whenever you are on the go and do not want to fall prey to forgotten passwords. It also holds a backlit keyboard, which makes it easier to work in the dark outside, whether you are at the back of your car or riding a late bus home. Both these features fulfill their purpose quite effortlessly.
 
Out of the basic features that the [***Acer Aspire***](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RF2123Z/ref=as_li_ss_tl?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-top-3&pf_rd_r=TC27QR8J79JQEXEHC0MD&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=6814c7b9-5072-4a55-95fd-923eea987e8d&pf_rd_i=12691228011&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=53402d62ff3154dc12450f6856f4905a&language=en_US) offers, one of the things that have been most commented on is its mobility. At 3.97lbs, the laptop remains exceptionally lightweight and easy to carry. It's been noted that its weight makes it a dream to use for those who are always on the go. Whereas, its thin frame and aluminum body add to its overall aesthetic and durability, respectively.
 
These features make the [***Acer Aspire 5 Slim***](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RF2123Z/ref=as_li_ss_tl?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-top-3&pf_rd_r=TC27QR8J79JQEXEHC0MD&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=6814c7b9-5072-4a55-95fd-923eea987e8d&pf_rd_i=12691228011&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=53402d62ff3154dc12450f6856f4905a&language=en_US) ideal for execs who have to carry their laptops from meeting to meeting, and for students who have to make their way to regular classes. Overall, the laptop computer strikes a great balance between looks and mobility.
 
Next comes the laptop's display, which so happens to be full HD, 1080x1920. Users note that the screen renders both video and internet content quite impressively. A few states that it does not provide the most vivid colors even in FHD, but they quickly justify that themselves by looking at the mightily affordable price tag. Conversely, others have been delighted with the display result right off the bat.
 
When it comes to performance, the [***Acer Aspire 5 Slim***](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RF2123Z/ref=as_li_ss_tl?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-top-3&pf_rd_r=TC27QR8J79JQEXEHC0MD&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=6814c7b9-5072-4a55-95fd-923eea987e8d&pf_rd_i=12691228011&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=53402d62ff3154dc12450f6856f4905a&language=en_US) proves itself to be quite the catch. It has a 1.6 GHz Intel Core i5-8265U processor with turbo boost up to 3.9 GHz, and it also carries 8GB DDR4 RAM. Due to these factors, it's been noted that the laptop provides excellent performance in entertainment, research, document editing, and light photoshop tasks. Through the combination of speed and efficiency that comes from these components, the laptop's users remain quite satisfied with what it has to offer.
 
Another feature that adds to this performance factor is the 256 GB PCIe NVMe SSD drive. Since the [***Acer Aspire 5 Slim***](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RF2123Z/ref=as_li_ss_tl?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-top-3&pf_rd_r=TC27QR8J79JQEXEHC0MD&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=6814c7b9-5072-4a55-95fd-923eea987e8d&pf_rd_i=12691228011&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=53402d62ff3154dc12450f6856f4905a&language=en_US) uses one of the most recent technologies for data storage and processing, it translates into quicker execution during real-world use. As such, the time taken between data transfer optimizes greatly, and the laptop runs faster.
 
Users comment that the laptop comes with great support for multitaskers that want to work through various devices. It has 4 USB Ports: 2 are USB 3.0 Gen 1, while 1 is USB 3.0 Type-C. A USB 2.0 is also present. With power-off charging in one of the ports, the laptop provides a way to charge phones for those who are always in search of a power outlet.
 
Other features include built-in 802.11 ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2, HD Webcam with 1280x720 resolution, HDMI port, and up to 9.5 hours of battery life. The laptop *ships with Windows 10 Home*. It's been noted that when all these features come together under a user who utilizes them frequently, the [***Acer Aspire 5 Slim***](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RF2123Z/ref=as_li_ss_tl?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-top-3&pf_rd_r=TC27QR8J79JQEXEHC0MD&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=6814c7b9-5072-4a55-95fd-923eea987e8d&pf_rd_i=12691228011&linkCode=ll1&tag=mrpowerscript-20&linkId=53402d62ff3154dc12450f6856f4905a&language=en_US) provides excellent value for money.
 
One negative thing that has been noted by even those who sing praises for the laptop is its cooling fan. The vent of the fan can be found at the base of the laptop. According to user comments, this makes the laptop a bit difficult to cool down, while the location of the vent also makes the laptop make noticeable noise.
