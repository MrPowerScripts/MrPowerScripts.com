On Google PageSpeed Insights I had a ~99 rating. I looked at it recently and it TANKED down to 44. 44! The whole point of this blog was to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YsFoEY7Ulo&amp;amp;list=PLqpaLALjc1lwz6nHCgsP98xYX_Ykawh3J&quot;&gt;journey into learning more about SEO&lt;/a&gt;. One of the most important metrics for Google Page rank and general SEO ranking is the speed of your website. 44 was unacceptable. I needed to change some things FAST to make the website FAST. I even have the charts to show how much faster it is. Wait until you see the results!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the site &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MrPowerScripts/MrPowerScripts.com&quot;&gt;is an open source repo hosted via GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; I have no control over server-side hosting decisions. Such as cache settings, and various other techniques that could help improve the performance to my website. Ya know what is really great for improving delivery of web assets? CDNs. Content Delivery Networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comes Cloudflare, one of the biggest CDNs on the web.  I didn’t do all the work to figure this out, to be honest. They posted their own &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/&quot;&gt;great blog post&lt;/a&gt; on how to set up their service in front of GitHub pages to cache ALL THE THINGS.  Once I configured MrPowerScripts.com on their service using the free plan all I had to do was update my name servers in NameCheap to use the ones they provided me. From there Cloudflare handled all of the caching and requests to the site. Dramatically reducing the page size and loading time.  Check the results for yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;img style=&quot;object-fit: contain&quot; src=&quot;/images/mrps-fast/page-size.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, the size of the page download is MUCH smaller. It went from ~1.5MB to ~205KB. That’s HUGE. The entire website size was reduced by over 1MB. Also, check out the number of requests needed to render the site. It went from around 38 requests to about 15. Yeah, it cut the number of requests by more than half. Amazing! All of that lead to the following chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;img style=&quot;object-fit: contain&quot; src=&quot;/images/mrps-fast/page-timings.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, the entire site took more than 4 seconds to load. Now, that doesn’t mean 4 seconds to see things on the page. It just means for the entire site to finish loading. Including various background requests. Now, the entire site loads in less than a second. These are amazing results! Cloudflare has allowed me to cache all site assets, and to keep them cached for up to 8 days. Then, the caches will be purged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creates a problem though. What if I update the website? Cloudflare will deliver the cached website they have stored rather than the latest updates i’ve pushed to GitHub Pages. Cloudflare has a nice API though, so i’ve connected CircleCI to my GitHub repository to run a job every time a push a commit. That job sends an API request to Cloudflare telling it to clear out the cache. The next person that visits the site will see the latest version of it, and Cloudflare will rebuild the cache. You can see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MrPowerScripts/MrPowerScripts.com/blob/f41b5b2a8d51b5f80f4d7da9bab33368d3b602c3/.circleci/config.yml&quot;&gt;the CircleCI config file here&lt;/a&gt; with the api call that perfoms the cache clearing. CircleCI has a generous open source plan (it’s free. that’s pretty generous). Now this isn’t perfect. It could be optimized to only purge the cache of certain pages, but it works for my simple little blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this costs me any money since i’m using the free tier of each application, and now my website is SUPER FAST once again.&lt;/p&gt;

Did you know that you don’t need Excel to work with Excel files? Sometimes doing things programmatically is a bit easier than pointing and clicking. Or maybe you need to process a lot of files really fast, over and over again. Powershell automation with Microsoft Excel is possible! &lt;!-- (1) video wrapper --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video you’ll see how you can update Excel workbooks and worksheets with a Powershell script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excel has a COM interface which is a technology developed by Microsoft  (of course). I’ve never read an amazing explanation of COM but basically, it allows communication between programming languages and Windows applications. Even if the application was not built with the programming language. Powershell is more of a scripting language, but we can connect to the Excel COM interface all the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this COM interface Excel exposes &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/overview/excel/object-model&quot;&gt;the Excel Object Model&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve linked you to the current docs, but that link will probably be dead in six months - because Microsoft. Also, the examples shown  for the Excel Object Model use something called Visual Basic for Applications. Which is something I learned about 5 minutes ago when I was trying to find the old generic Excel Object Model reference. Apparently it doesn’t exist anymore. Once again, because Microsoft. I wish I could offer more help and insights but - Microsoft. Still, you can use the script below to play around with creating and updating workbooks and worksheets. You can also explore the properties of the excel object with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Get-Member&lt;/code&gt; to learn more about the available options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MrPowerScripts/PowerScripts/blob/16740162b415b9d91f9d4bbd930b2a6d33de1788/Excel/WorkbooksAndWorksheetsExcel.ps1&quot;&gt;find the file here on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; or check out the source below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#None of this will work through an already open excel application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#You must open Excel and workbooks you want to manipulate via the COMobject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

IT. FREAKING. WORKS. &lt;a href=&quot;/help-me-automate-my-youtube-channel/&quot;&gt;I wrote a few months ago about this idea to automate my youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;. Now, at the time the idea wasn’t really well defined. I decided I wanted to do something and then I had to figure out how I was going to do it. I should have &lt;a href=&quot;/nobody-gives-a-damn-about-your-idea/&quot;&gt;shut up and built it first&lt;/a&gt;, but I was too excited and prematurely let the idea out. It happens to everyone. Over time though I crafted a more well-defined concept. You can see the whole evolution in this playlist in fact.
&lt;!-- (1) video wrapper --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;youtube-video&quot; data-embed=&quot;videoseries?list=PLqpaLALjc1lyekGkzAltr50RD3RD3kA4d&amp;amp;modestbranding=1&amp;amp;enablejsapi=1&quot;&gt; 
 
    &lt;!-- (2) the &quot;play&quot; button --&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;play-button&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 
     
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I finally put together something I would consider a prototype. Despite many hiccups, lingering issues, and generally losing faith in the idea I managed to put together the scaffolding for a working project. This is how it all works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all starts with a yaml file to describe the video that should be created. Here’s the file for the first episode.
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist-it.appspot.com/github/mrpowerscripts/automated-reality-channel/blob/master/scripts/arc-ep-1.yml?slice=0:30&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
The yaml file has an array which describes each scene of the video. Each scene describes what should be shown on the screen. To start off simple I chose to stick with providing an image and using text-to-speech to generate some dialogue, which is also described in the yaml file. In the future, it should recognize if the content is a video or if the audio is from a file as well. It will pull all of the assets accordingly and then builds each scene as described in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scenes&lt;/code&gt; array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script file is ingested through the PowerBot Discord bot that runs in &lt;a href=&quot;https:/bit.ly/mrps-discord&quot;&gt;my discord channel&lt;/a&gt;. I can run commands in Discord that tell the bot what to do. Such as building the video by passing it the script file above. Here’s a bit of the Discord bot code. You can click the footer to see the rest.
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist-it.appspot.com/github/MrPowerScripts/mrps-discord-powerbot/blob/master/veditor.js?slice=0:30&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the record, I’m completely ashamed of this code. I have no idea how to code in nodejs and a lot of this was done at 3 am when I should have been well asleep. Instead, I produced the monstrosity you see above. Anyway, the build function is what generates the video files from the script yaml. First, it downloads all of the assets which are images in this case. It uses &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FFmpeg&lt;/code&gt; to turn the images and audio of each scene into an individual video file. The audio at the moment is generated using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;espeak&lt;/code&gt; text-to-speak application. Once each scene is generated &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FFmpeg&lt;/code&gt; once again combines all of the individual video files into a single video. How cool is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the build is created I can preview the generated video. If I like what I see I can run a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;publish&lt;/code&gt; command that will automatically upload the video to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/mrps-arc&quot;&gt;Automated Reality Channel&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube. So, here I am to present the very first episode for your viewing pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- (1) video wrapper --&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;youtube-video&quot; data-embed=&quot;h8esG-ZwwY4&quot;&gt; 
 
    &lt;!-- (2) the &quot;play&quot; button --&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;play-button&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 
     
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay. That wasn’t very impressive. It’s a start though! Next, I would like to polish up a lot of the code. There’s a bunch of bugs. Sometimes it crashes. Nothing is really optimized. So, time to learn how to properly code in an async environment. Well, learn as best as I can. Also, remove a lot of the code duplication. A lot of the functions could be composed better. Also, adding some of the other elements that I talked about. Such as publishing drafts of individual scenes for people to vote on with emojis. SHowing draft previews that also allow voting. Allowing people to submit scene suggestions through discord commands. Such as text-to-speech scripts, or scene images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of work to do. But the idea has reached a much more concrete position, and it works.

When you’re running in a DevOps workflow such as continuous integration and delivery you may not have as many resources. This can cause your builds to run out of memory. Here are some quick tips to help reduce the memory usage of your Gradle and Kotlin builds for Android development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tell-java-to-chill-out-with-the-memory-usage&quot;&gt;Tell Java to chill out with the memory usage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since android build tools are Java-based, and Java is a memory hog, you can first tell Java to limit its memory usage. You might see people put these same options in a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GRADLE_OPTS&lt;/code&gt; variable but if the process gets forked those options won’t always get passed down into the forked process. It’s better to set an environment variable consumed direction by Java. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_JAVA_OPTIONS&lt;/code&gt; environment variable is widely supported in Oracle based Java environments. Combined with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-Xmx&lt;/code&gt; configuration you can set the max heap size for use by Java, which is where it stores things like class objects into memory. Setting this value to 75% of the available memory will give Java enough room to store what it needs without choking the rest of the system resources. If you have 4GB available, then try setting it to  3GB. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_JAVA_OPTIONS=-Xmx3g&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;shut-down-the-daemons&quot;&gt;Shut down the daemons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a tip for both Gradle and Kotlin as they each have their own daemons. The daemons run in the background and help speed up re-compilation times by storing generated project information from previous compilation times. Typically when running in a CI workflow you won’t be recompiling anything as environments are reset each time. In this case, the daemon will take up extra memory without providing any benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using these methods to control memory use in your Android DevOps lifecycle can reduce out of memory failures within environments that don’t have limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>MrPowerScripts</name></author><category term="mrpowerscripts" /><category term="java memory" /><category term="android development" /><category term="gradle memory" /><category term="kotlin memory" /><summary type="html">When you’re building your android project locally your machines probably have a lot of horsepower.

If you want to monetize your content you need to be especially careful. If the content you create utilizes the copyrighted works of others then you might be in for a world of pain. Thankfully Creative Commons has been around for a few years helping content creators by creating content licenses. &lt;!-- (1) video wrapper --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;youtube-video&quot; data-embed=&quot;J_qTrc_fV-Y&quot;&gt; 
 
    &lt;!-- (2) the &quot;play&quot; button --&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;play-button&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 
     
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These licenses are easy for content creators to understand, and help them share their works for others to use in various ways. One license is incredibly useful for content creators to know about, which is the CC0 license&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CC0 license allows a content creator to revoke all copyrights to the content they’ve created. Thus allowing anyone to use that content in their own private or commercial projects. Need a happy person to include in your marketing ad? It’s difficult and time-consuming to hire a model and snap the pictures yourself. It can also be expensive to buy stock photography. Especially if you have little to no budget. Thankfully there’s a lot of places that already exist where you can find CCO license photos or other kinds of content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite place to find CC0 license content is &lt;a href=&quot;https://pexels.com&quot;&gt;pexels.com&lt;/a&gt;. They have been around for a few years now, and their collections are always growing. They have all types of high-quality photography available under the CC0 license, so you can use them safely in your own projects without fear of violating someone elses copyrights. Pexels has also added a video site, which can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://video.pexels.com&quot;&gt;Pexels video&lt;/a&gt;. The Pexels video collection isn’t as large since it is a recent edition, but it will continue to grow over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also contributed to Pexels by submitting over a hundred of my own photos for people to use. I log in every once in a while to check out the stats and see the download counter go up. I wish there was a way for me to know how my images were being used. It would be cool to see a picture I took modified and used for a magazine, or a brochure. In any case, I’m happy others are able to find some use for them instead of letting them sit on a hard drive somewhere never to be looked at again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have your own photography or videos you think others might find useful consider uploading them to Pexels. Sure, one day you might sell that random photo of a sunflower for a million dollars. It’s tempting to hold onto the copyrights. You might have some others worth sharing though.

I have a terrible sense of design really. Though I feel like it has improved considerably over the years. Hopefully, that trend continues. And while I believe through hard work anyone can become great at what they put their mind to some people simply have an innate advantage. That’s okay because collaboration is what makes every project great. I don’t know anyone who built something great by themselves. The Great Pyramid of Giza?  The internet? Kim Kardashian’s butt? All of these took the efforts of many to achieve their notoriety. People have always built off the efforts or inspirations of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I need insights and inspirations to guide me on designs I reach out to my buddy Ben Rossi. He’s an exceptional UX designer and general maker of awesome things. I told him I needed up update the look of my blog. It was hastily put together so I could start exploring SEO techniques. Well, now I want it to look pretty, and he was happy to help me by providing some inspiration and tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, the previous site was incredibly dull. I didn’t utilize color in any meaningful way, and the color I did have came from clashing social icons. He suggested I make things more colorful, and that was a great idea. I need to stop being afraid of using color. MORE color! One of the examples he shared was a website he’s followed for a long time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kottke.org/&quot;&gt;which is also a blog&lt;/a&gt;. I loved it! I played around with some ideas and for the time being I’ve settled with a three-color gradient spanning the entire header. This also creates a nice separation between navigation and content. I’ve removed the social icons for now to simplify the process. I’ll figure out how to merge them back later in a way that blends with the new theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;old-design&quot;&gt;Old Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mrps-pretty/old-header.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-design&quot;&gt;New Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mrps-pretty/new-header.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another suggestion was to adjust the line spacing size and utilize some multiple of 4. I don’t remember why. If I have time to bug him again I’ll go back an ask to update this post. He’s the export and I’m simply taking shade in his shadow. I should also take note to take better notes… later. In the images above you can see the line spacing and font size have been slightly increased, and I have to say to does read better for me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After adjusting the spacing it was time to give the fonts a bit of love. I did a bit of research on this myself and found some that I truly love. For headings, I went with &lt;a href=&quot;https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat&quot;&gt;Montserrat Bold&lt;/a&gt; created by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JulietaUla/Montserrat&quot;&gt;Julieta Ulanovsky&lt;/a&gt; and inspired by the old posters and signs in the traditional Montserrat neighborhood of Buenos Aires. I was not expecting the font to have a cute story behind it, but there you have it. I love it. For body text, I went with the popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans&quot;&gt;Open Sans&lt;/a&gt; created by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/@SteveMatteson1&quot;&gt;Steve Matteson&lt;/a&gt;. This is a super popular font in recent years and I like the readability of it. I’ve been using it for projects for a long time. I searched around for other options but I don’t see a reason to deviate from what works well here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another suggestion was to break the uniformity of my posts on the index page. I had a very strict format which I unwittingly created. I’m definitely a creature of habit and don’t always recognize when i’ve burrowed myself into a cycle. A rigid design pattern in this case. If the post had an associated video to go along with it I would post the video right under the title, and then the post’s introductory paragraph, and then a link to read more. First off, people come to a blog to read, so sticking a video a the beginning seems is a bit nonsensical in hindsight. But I do want to keep the videos on there in the hopes it adds some clicks. What’s the solution?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again as suggested from Ben and drawing inspiration from Kottke’s blog I’ve added the videos either somewhere in the middle of the intro paragraphs or at the end. The added benefit of this is offering an opportunity to read some of the posts first before giving the option of clicking the video. Rather than the previous format where the video is already scrolled off the screen (in the case of mobile) before you have a chance to read what it may be about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made another small update because of something I found frustrating on mobile. I had a “read more” button that was positioned to the right of the screen. Sometimes I’m using my left hand on mobile and it made it difficult to scroll and select the “read more” button unless I was using my right hand. Now the button spans the entire width of the post. Lefties rejoice! Also, keeping with the new colorful header I changed the color of the button to a much lighter blue. I’m not in love with this as the moment and I’m going to keep experimenting with ideas for the button here. It works tho.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another small change was adding a space between the post title and the content for metadata. At the moment it only shows an estimated reading time for the post. I’ll be adding some other metadata such as author, post date, and potentially a social sharing option. I still have to figure out how I’m going to work that last one in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, how about some animations?  This is something I totally stumbled upon without planning. I wanted to add some animations to the “read more” button to make it stand out a bit when I came across the starfield.  I added a parallax starfield to the header based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/saransh/pen/BKJun&quot;&gt;this codepen&lt;/a&gt; that I found. Based on… I ripped the code and figured out have to shove it into the header. It kinda reminds me of Goku charging of a spirit bomb, and I think it fits with my “Power Up” page. It’s a bit cheesy, but for now, I enjoy looking at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn’t perfect. I still need to work on colors, sizing, and adding other elements. I’m much happier looking at the current state than I did before tho. I won’t be taking on any design jobs soon, but thankfully I have great people and inspirations to help me to improve.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>MrPowerScripts</name></author><category term="mrpowerscripts" /><category term="web design" /><category term="website improvemnets" /><category term="design improvements. making mrepowerscripts.com pretty" /><summary type="html">I’m not a designer.

Most of them have been amazing experiences, but not all of them have been pleasant. The worst experience by far still bothers the shit out of me to this today. There were so many wrong things happening it upsets me I stuck around as long as I did. A month and a half. What a weird experience from start to end. I found this advert looking for someone to do part-time IT work on Craigslist,  and it all went downhill from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://anchor.fm/mrpowerscripts/embed/episodes/My-worst-experience-working-for-a-company-e3ih3l&quot; id=&quot;iframe-resize&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was working for myself at the time as a freelance IT guy, which was a lot of fun for a while. I went to lots of peoples homes and helped them with their computer issues. Still, I was getting tired of driving all over the place as well as all the other hassles of freelance life. I wanted to find something more consistent and local. So a part-time IT job seemed like a nice way to receive some consistent income without having to run around all over the map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They liked my resume and called me in for an interview. I interviewed with the owner of the company. It was a business that did a lot of work in the area. Their company logo was all over the region because of the type of industry they were in. I remember thinking “oh cool, I’ve seen this company before. This should be fun”. As fun as missing the head of a nail and wacking yourself with a hammer, as it turned out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same day of the interview I got another call about the job. They’d like me to start next week. Awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following week arrives and I show up. It’s a fairly small office with about ten other people working there. The owner brought me around to meet everyone and immediately something felt off. Besides a couple of key people close to the owner, everyone felt very… cold. Not in a rude way, but no one seemed excited or happy. At all. There was a sense of looming death in the air and I couldn’t figure it out. But hey it’s Monday so whatever. Who is happy on a Monday?  I’m sure things will get better. Wrong again bucko!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I met everyone I was taken to my desk and shown my computer. It didn’t work. I was told once I get it working I can start using it. Well, that’s what I’m here for so okay. Someone crimped the ethernet cable wrong. They had the materials and tools to make a new cable so I went ahead and made one. A few minutes later and I finally had internet access to get my emails. Everyone had like Hotmail accounts or something using POP3 with outlook express.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had never seen an office in such technical disarray. The owner’s office had a really nice brand new looking PC. Everyone else in the office had what looked like recycled machines of various brands and operating systems. Some with Windows XP (professional &amp;amp; home),  Windows 2000. and Windows Vista (professional &amp;amp; home). If that alone doesn’t hurt you to read then consider yourself fortunate. I almost cried. They had a single “server” which acted as a file store. People accessed files through manually mapped drives from their client machines to shares on the “server”, as well as manually mapped drives to each other’s computers. There was no central management whatsoever. The server didn’t even run server software. It was a bunch of terminals jerry-rigged together. Oh no…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the IT guy, part of my job there was to go around and help everyone with issues they had with their computers. I would come in that day and see what problems people had in my inbox then go around and help them. This is where I realized how bad things were, and why everyone was so cold from the onset. It wasn’t that they weren’t excited to see me. They all hated the owner and his presence killed any emotion in the room. He was a psychopath and they all feared him. That’s exactly how he liked it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was really interesting because the owner trusted me much more so than other employees. We spent a lot of time together while I was helping him with tasks. I was his personal technology assistant. He would take me to BestBuy to help him look at TVs. Not for the office of course. This was for his home. He had no clue whatsoever about tech, and so any opportunity he could leverage my experience he did. During these moments he would try to share little “life lessons” with me that started to reveal how horrible of a person he really was. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As time went on and I got to know individuals they began opening up with me about different office happenings. Do you know how weird it is to work with people and they’re all telling you various things about each other? “Don’t trust this person”. Then that persons tells you to watch out for another person. Holy crap the people there were really on edge. I’m just here to get your file share working again yo. I’m nodding my head and people are getting deep into their beefs. I’m trying to figure out why a Windows XP machine keeps losing the connection to a Vista machine. Short answer - Windows Vista was a huge piece of shit. Here’s a heavy helping of drama to go along with the technical issues. Lucky me. It was obviously not a healthy place for anyone there. I felt really bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one person they all talked about though was the owner, and how terrible he was. The workers were assets, not people. They were treated as such. If people were caught socializing for even a moment they were admonished with boorish remarks lobbed from across the office.  Everyone was to be at their desks working at all times. I think that’s partially why people opened up and chatted with me so much. I was their only opportunity for basic human contact through much of the day. There was no concept of “team” in this place. Everyone seemed to fend for themselves in one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had some employees whose job was clearly to bully others and act as “the muscle” to enforce these parameters while he was away. One of these enforcers was your typical knucklehead. Big guy. Liked to chew tobacco and spit it right into his trash for everyone else to enjoy the aroma. Would not shut the fuck up about how popular he was in high school. Everyone feared him as much as he feared the owner himself. Everything around this place was structured around fear. Ugh…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many moments that are comically moviesque I still can’t even believe it sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a day when I was down on the floor working on someone’s computer in her office. We were talking about her and where she’s from. Light stuff. Unprovoked she started making some comments about how not to trust certain people. I’m not even going to repeat exactly what she was saying because it was pretty bad. Once again, I’m just trying to figure out why your phone doesn’t have a dial tone and this discussion is starting to turn dark. But as she continues to talk I realized that “people” was really a description of the owner. It was wild how many people tried to clue me into this stuff. Really. It was like they were all prisoners trying to tell me to get out as soon as possible. I tried to steer things in a more positive direction and we continued to chat. A few moments later I turn around and the owner is looming over us in the doorway of her office. I have no clue how long he was standing there, but he was definitely taking advantage of us being unaware. “What are you doing?”…  he asked. “I’m fixing the phone…”, I replied. “Sounds like a lot of talking and not working”. We didn’t say anything as he walked away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their chief accountant was a typical sleazy money guy. I remember one day he started yelling on the phone at someone loud enough for everyone to hear. “Well, he’s not my business partner any more because he stole $10,000 from me!” before slamming the phone down. This, apparently an issue related to his own personal business.  Good to see the kind of company these people keep. And the kind of people the company keeps. He and the owner seemed like best buddies. Obviously, you gotta treat the guy who manages all your money well. One day the CA tasked me with going to McDonald’s and told me to get some free food. He wanted to test my negotiating skills. I was given $20 and tasked to negotiate. At McDonald’s. I did not do that. Ugh…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a time that the owner wanted to buy a projector so he could do presentations in one of the rooms. We had a big debate on what impacts the size of the projection. The available distance from the wall is important, and I wasn’t sure the room was big enough. He disagreed that distance had any relevance to the size of the projection. It was the first time we really butted heads on something. I had to call up a retail store and put them on speakerphone and pretend I didn’t know anything about projectors so they would explain all the important details to me. Eventually, I asserted his opinion on the subject and the retail employee was quick to correct me. The debate stopped immediately after I hung up and he asked me to buy whatever projector I thought would work best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One event really bothered me. I came to his office to help him with something. He had a stack of checks on his desk that he was signing. Out of nowhere, he began ranting about how it makes him physically sick that he has to give all this money away. These were for employees and contractors that did very difficult laborious work for him. He considered paying people for their efforts giving money away. That made me physically sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should have left by this point. Unfortunately, my car broke down during my employment there. I had to stop servicing my personal clients and now I REALLY needed the money if I ever wanted that car to work again. I wasn’t exactly livin’ it up at this point so this was a huge blower for me. Now I’m stuck here. Thankfully the walk to work was only about twenty-five minutes and It was summer time. So at least I could continue this until I got my car situation figured out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tipping point arrived not too long after all this though. He had a buddy who owned another company in the area. I’m guessing his buddy was talking about all of his cool tech equipment and offered to give the owner some extra stuff he had. We both went to visit his buddies company to pick up the equipment. It was like night and day. This guy obviously spent boatloads on his IT infrastructure. They had a proper server room with a rack. Everything was wired up clean around the building. It was amazing. Really. The whole setup was impressive. The type of business environment I was used to working in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His buddy gave him a hardware internet filter. It didn’t work for some reason, but the owner was okay with that. “It’s okay if it doesn’t work. As long as people THINK I know what they’re doing they’ll be scared. Can you wire it so it looks connected?”. Ugh….. At one point his buddy mentioned something that they do there, and the owner asked me to set that up as well. I don’t remember what it was. I told him we can’t do it because we don’t have an Exchange Server. His buddy jumps in with “What? You don’t have an Exchange Server? You’re missing out!”. The owner had no idea what an Exchange Server was, but now he had to have one. I figured this was finally a chance to get the guy to spend some money revamping his IT infrastructure. If only I could still be so young an optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time Microsoft had an offering called Small Business Server. It was a bundle with Microsoft Server 2003 that had Active Directory, Exchange, and some other cool things in a pricing model targeted for smaller companies. It was perfect. He could host everything using his existing “server” hardware. Though most of the terminals would have to be wiped and reinstalled with a professional license for windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did all the due diligence for pricing of the software and terminals that would need to be updated to work with the new system. I put it all in a document and shared it with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He almost had a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, it was not chump change but that was the cost of the setup. He wanted everything his buddy had without spending any of the money. This is where things turned even worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He found out through a friend that by being an authorized Microsoft software distributor you can buy all the software we needed at a huge discount. He excitedly told me to go sign us up to the program online. “uhh that program is for companies that provide IT and software services. We don’t do any of that here”, I said. That wasn’t a problem. “If you tell them we sell software then we’re a software seller”. I told him that I didn’t think that’s how the program worked. Then he sent his CA to further convince me it would fine. There wasn’t any problem at all and I was being ridiculous. This is where they became really pushy. They wanted me to sign up as the contact to register the company as a software distributor so we could buy the software we needed at a huge discount and use it. They weren’t giving up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really needed this job. I wasn’t having success finding anything else I could walk to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went into his office and quit the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told them I would finish out the week, but I wouldn’t be able to continue after that. They were floored, and couldn’t understand why I wanted to go. Maybe it’s because I don’t want to commit fraud on your behalf and then have y’all throw me under the bus when you inevitably get caught? I just told them the position wasn’t for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final days there were really strange. I did my best to tie off some loose ends and advise some of the more technical employees how to fix common issues that came up. Many of them knew and understood why I was leaving. It was a small office and everyone talked when the bullies weren’t parading around squashing morale.  A couple people even asked for my contact info so they could recommend me to places their friends or significant others worked. They even called me back a few weeks later to come back.&lt;/p&gt;

They’ll pretend they do if they like you, but that’s the best you’re gonna get. Everyone has ideas. If a snowflake fell every time someone had a great idea we’d all be buried up to our necks in snow. And ya know what? That snow would be way more useful than the ideas that produced it. A snowperson, snow angels, snowballs - there’s a lot of fun to be had in the snow. Your ideas, however, aren’t worth a damn. And nobody cares about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what people care about? Actions. Motion. Shiny things they can look at and go “oooooooooooo, pretty”. Ideas carry weight when we can see them in living color. Well, at that juncture they’re no longer ideas, and that’s really the point. If you truly want people to care you need to bring your ideas to real life. Anyone can have an idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s precisely why ideas without actions are so useless. People love to sit around and wax poetic about things they would love to do or want to do. It’s not a skill, and you’re not going to sell anyone on the idea that you’re a great ideas person. Unless of course, you have a history of turning your ideas into actions and delivering. Even people with such a reputation still have refuters and detractors. Delivering on ideas is the hard part, and if you want people to respect your ideas you need to start delivering something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m entirely guilty of this myself. I’ve had a lot of “amazing ideas” that I never even tried to bring to life. But I wanted people to respect them because they were great! Hell, I’m blameworthy as I write this after announcing this great idea &lt;a href=&quot;/help-me-automate-my-youtube-channel/&quot;&gt;to automate my YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;. Spoiler alert: It didn’t work out the way I thought it would. It’s a lot harder than I thought. Surprise surprise. Have I made progress? Sure. Is it even close to the idea I envisioned? Not even a little bit. I should have shut the hell up and built something that works first. I’m not sure if it’ll ever get finished at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’m not saying you shouldn’t have ideas. Ideas are great. It’s fun to think up things you want to make or goals you want to reach. It feels good to bring them up in conversation and have other people validate your thoughts. But that’s the key issue with falling in love with the idea and sharing them with everyone. People tend to grow content with that validation and lose motivation in delivering. This isn’t even just my option. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://sivers.org/zipit&quot;&gt;studies that have shown&lt;/a&gt; when you profess your ideas you’re less motivated to achieve them. Well, shit. I fell into that trap again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t always end up like that though. Sometimes you can find the motivation in other ways to break past patting yourself on the back for thinking something up and then calling it a day. I remember a long time ago in a company far, far away I had an idea that would totally improve one of the systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was working on a project that provided a service which assuredly you’ve used at least once in your life (if you live in the USA at least). Part of my role was managing the operating system images that were used to provision machines before they were sent out into the field. “The field” was a network of more than 50,000 computer terminals across the entire United States. It was big, and terminals had to be replaced all the time for various reasons. It was critical that systems are deployed as fast as possible without any errors. Our imaging process was a computer replacement pipeline to keep this heavily used network up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used Norton Ghost as the solution to deploy the images to terminals. There wasn’t really any better option at the time. Norton Ghost was the best imaging solution, and it wasn’t cheap because of that. There was a lot of aspects to the system that made it cumbersome to manage. Ghost images were sector-based, and so images ended up being the same size as the hard drive you pulled the image from because of that. If the hard drive was 20GB then that was the size of your image. Even if the data only took up 4GB.  So we had around six different terminal images which each had either 20GB or 40GB hard drives. Even calculating the low end, this meant we had 120GB of image data to manage.  This was 2011 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/751847/worldwide-seagate-western-digital-average-hard-drive-capacity/&quot;&gt;when hard drives were still slow and Gigabytes were still expensive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, but it gets better. There wasn’t a single image for each machine. The final image was built up after creating seven different layers of images. The first layer contained the basic vanilla operating system. Then the second layer contained all of the latest operating system updates. Then the third layer would contain all of the custom hardware drivers and software. This continued on until you had a final image which was ready to deploy to the terminal. Now each machine had seven images, so let’s redo our math.  20GB * 7 layers * 6 machines resulted in 840GB worth of images. Mind you, this is our hypothetical low end, which was not the reality. If you had to update one of the layers it meant you had to re-create all of the successive layers after that, and it was a regular practice to maintain the images this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a slow laborious process using expensive software and the whole setup itself was expensive to store and slow manage.  I hated it. Because I was the one that had to manage it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a bit of research, I found out about a new tool created and distributed for free by Microsoft to manage deployments of their operating system better.  It was called WIM images. This was a very new tool, and nobody seemed to know much about it at the time. It was difficult for me to understand as well since I was just learning how to automate things with batch scripts. Oh, batch scripts. I don’t miss you at all. It had the possibility to solve so many problems we faced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WIM images only took up the amount of space equal to the amount of data on the drive. So if you created a WIM image from a 20GB hard drive and there was only 4GB of data on the drive then your resulting image was only 4GB. Also, you could append images to each other and it would only increase the image size by the size of the new data. It would not duplicate file data between appended images. So with our layering process, we could combine all seven layers into a single image that was able to fit on a DVD. A single set of machine images that took at minimum 120GB of data could now be the size of a DVD. That also made them FAST to provision. A process which previously took up 15-20 minutes to deploy could now be completed in a few minutes. Also, did I mention it was free? FREE. NO LICENSING TO DEAL WITH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all the research I  was confident this is something we could hack together with scripts to replace our existing expensive cumbersome system. I remember the day I excitedly went to my team lead and shared my idea to update the system with this new solution. I explained all of the benefits as best I could and shared my desire for us to build this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait? What!? But this is amazing! This is going to save us so much time, money, headaches. It might even cure baldness it’s so good! Steve Balmer will come and thank me personally. I didn’t let it go that day. I shared it with other colleagues in front of him. He had to listen to me ramble on about this idea all day since our team shared a small common area. That did not go over well. “We are NOT going to do this. Stop wasting time with it.”, was the last statement he made about it before leaving the room. That was the end of our discussion about it that week. That infuriated me. Here I was spending my own time outside work hours figuring out how we could make things better, faster, stronger and I was told off in front of my peers for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck. That.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timing couldn’t have been better. He went on vacation the following week which left our team to manage ourselves. Every single day I worked feverishly to learn more about WIM images enough to put together a proof of concept. I would blaze through finishing my daily tasks before lunchtime and spent the afternoon hacking away with batch scripts and the WIM tools to produce a client/server deployment setup similar to our existing system. And it was certainly similar to our existing system, except better in every single way possible. I could have an entire machine image saved to a single DVD. That image could be deployed to any system within a few minutes by having the machine boot to a USB that automatically identified the system type and pulled the correct image. It worked, and it worked amazingly well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was no longer merely an idea. I had something to show off. When he returned from vacation I asked him to come see something. I gave a demonstration of the process which took all of a few minutes. I wish I could explain the 180 degrees turn his attitude took this time around. He now realized the magnitude of implementing this within our business process. This was huge. The gears started turning in his head and HE was convincing ME of other benefits that I hadn’t even thought of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately, that day, he encouraged me to continue building out the rest of the images and system while also tasking another colleague to help with this process.  “How fast do you think you could finish this?”. It was basically already finished. We just needed to create the images for the other systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It did everything I said it could do, but he absolutely did not care until he saw it in action. This is not unique to him, and I never held the scenario against him. He was acting in the best interests of the team at the time. Ideas without action don’t hold value, and I spent a whole day rambling on about this one. In his eyes, I produced no value that day. I was, effectively, wasting the companies time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There still stands the caveat that some people have a reputation for delivering, and so their ideas hold far more weight. I was probably the youngest person within the entire wing of the building in my early 20’s and the least experienced person on the team. I could barely read a batch script when I joined. A year later I think I can replace an entire system that existed for 5+ years developed by multiple talented engineers? Yeah right. Go back to your desk and shut up, kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had I stayed at that position I’m sure my thoughts would have carried further weight in future discussions, but I moved on to new challenges shortly after. Though I did stay long enough to see through having my proof of concept developed further and deployed into production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had I not been admonished by my team lead in front of my colleagues I might have sat content with everyone telling me how cool the idea was. “Wouldn’t this be cool?” “It sure would!”. Book closes. End of story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I swear tho I’m going to automate that youtube channel. It’s such a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>MrPowerScripts</name></author><category term="mrpowerscripts" /><category term="nobody gives a damn about your idea" /><summary type="html">Really.

You spend a short period of time with someone who is whisking you around the city. You might have a chat with them, or maybe you prefer to have a quiet ride. Sometimes they’ll even offer you treats, or refreshments if you’re lucky! Then, in the end, you judge each other based on a 5-star rating. No pressure. Your Uber rating is intended to give drivers some vague insight into the person they’ll be picking up, but it also has some advantages as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uber has a program called Uber Star. It might not be available everywhere, but it is where I am. This is a program where if you take at least 10 rides every month, and maintain a high uber rating (4.8 or higher) you’ll have access to Uber Star cars. They’re the same as the regular economy option, but the difference being only drivers with a rating of 4.8 or higher will be able to see your ride request. The best for the best!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uber Star drivers are more likely to have comforts like free wifi, candy, or bottled water. Why should I settle for less? I mean, I am an Uber Star, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had a fairly good Uber rating. Hovering around 4.85. Not the best, but it qualified me for the program each month. But I noticed I had a period where it started to slip. I saw it went down to 4.84 one day. I didn’t worry. I’m still well within range. Then it hit 4.83, and panic set in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is going on? How did I start falling so far? I couldn’t pinpoint it. I couldn’t think of any behaviors that changed to warrant such a dramatic decline putting my Uber Star status at risk. It was time to do something, and I set out to hack my Uber rating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I thought maybe I could hack Uber’s servers. I would manually change the ratings that drivers gave to me, so they would all say five stars. My Uber Star status would be safe from the whims of drivers judgments upon me. I could continue to enjoy my candies and water with peace of mind. Then, I realized that’s probably really difficult, a lot of work, and fairly illegal. I had to think of a different vector for this attack&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social Engineering &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalguardian.com/blog/social-engineering-attacks-common-techniques-how-prevent-attack&quot;&gt;is by far the most common form of a security threat for companies&lt;/a&gt;. If that’s what many professional hackers are using, why wouldn’t it work here? I figured my best bet was to hack the drivers instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to success here is that after the ride is finished the driver will select 5-stars when they are given the choice to rate me. This relies on their memory of the trip which just occurred. That’s the key bit here. It doesn’t matter what actually happened on the trip. Only what they remember in the moment of judgment. Their memory is what I need to exploit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory in people isn’t a very straightforward subject. How we perceive events of the past can become distorted in many different ways. There are [various well-studied memory biases[(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_memory_biases) that illustrate how your memory of an event can be quite subjective. Memory biases are not the only ones that could impact how the driver chooses to rate me, whether they’re conscious of them or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bias against race, religions, genders, or other elements of our identity are very common. Since I have no control over those biases I excluded them as a concern in my approach here. If a driver gives me a poor rating because they don’t like my face there’s not much I can do about that. Instead, I chose to focus on the elements that I could control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another bias that people may succumb to is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias&quot;&gt;the negativity bias&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, negative events have a larger impact on one’s psychological state than positive ones of equal intensity. Let’s use receiving or losing an ice cream as an example. If I give you ice cream it might make you a bit happier, but if you drop that ice cream you’ll feel way worse than any happiness generated by receiving it. The loss has far more impact on you than the gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have a memory of when I was around six years old at the zoo. We stopped on a footbridge to admire some birds swimming around below us. My ice cream slipped and fell into the water where all the animals made a dash to devour it in front of me. I cried. A lot. I don’t remember anything else about that trip. I’ve been given countless ice creams since then, and I couldn’t recall a single one of them. Negative events tend to leave a deeper lasting impact than good ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By understanding various biases of memory and mood I believed I could use those factors to influence the driver’s decision. I broke down the various elements of a trip to then think about the most effective actions for each portion in maximizing a potential 5-star rating. These are the elements of a trip I felt could have an impact on their final decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the waiting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the greeting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the ride&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the farewell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waiting. Few people like to wait. Especially when waiting costs you money. Uber drivers are providing their time as a service, and the more people they can serve within a given period of time the more money they make. If you make them wait you’re costing them money and they might carry a negative view of you through the entire trip. Regardless of how nice you seem. I made sure to avoid this. I was ready to flag down the driver and hop in immediately every single trip. This was the easy part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next two can be grouped together under some basic ideas we learned from the various stated biases. Some people might think it’s a good idea to be friendly to the driver by being very communicative. But given how conversations can take weird turns, or you can say something that the other party dislikes without realizing it, the best strategy is to talk as little as possible. Reducing the potential for negative interactions can far outweigh the benefit of many positive interactions. One negative interaction can outweigh any earned goodwill, and you may not even realize what you’ve done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My greetings from the point of starting this practice were always polite and brief. I verified my name with the driver, gave a friendly hello, and then shut up. During the ride itself, I would not engage the drivers in conversation. I’m not the most talkative person, to begin with, but I would get into fairly detailed discussions with drivers regularly.  Though now if they engaged with me I would kindly answer questions directly without much of a follow-up. If they made some comment with the expectation of a response I would provide some neutral response affirming I recognized whatever observation they had made. It was important to find a soft balance between brief and curt. The idea is to come across like a vanilla passenger.  Boring, uninteresting, and not worth engaging or casting any judgment upon - yet. By limiting these interactions I  reduced the chance of saying something that could leave a negative impression on the driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of you chatty Cathys might think it comes across as rude to not engage in discussion, and in some ways you’re right. But I’m sure you’ve heard the famous quote &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It's better to keep your mouth shut and appear stupid than open it and remove all doubt&lt;/code&gt;. By remaining friendly yet neutral it removes the opportunity for the driver to be sure about any negative inclination they might ascribe to a reserved personality. Are you being rude, or are you just a completely boring nitwit? Tough call, and there’s room for doubt. That doubt is easier to mend in our final stage than would be from inciting a negative response, intentionally or not, through increased interactions. You have to cross this minefield either way, and your best bet is to limit the number of footsteps it takes. Positioning for a neutral experience in the greeting and ride sets the stage for the grand finale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t managed to put your foot in your mouth the ride should have been pleasant. Nothing noteworthy. A normal, everyday ride. Now, we can focus on the farewell. This was the key change that I believe had the most impact on scoring. I was overly polite, engaging, and communicative during the farewell portion. Oh, I laid it on THICK with politeness and friendliness. This is where the memory hacks start to take place. I wanted the farewell to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak%E2%80%93end_rule&quot;&gt;the most prominent and pleasant interaction of the trip&lt;/a&gt;. Being overt and talkative right at the end will have a lasting impact on the personal memory of you and their view of the trip. Their muddled doubts should melt away with the sheer force of your polite posturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To continue in that vein the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial-position_effect#Recency_effect&quot;&gt;recency effect&lt;/a&gt; explains that given a list of items a person will have the easiest time remembering the last items, then the first items, and finally the items in the middle.  Consider all of the interactions with the driver as items in a list. Those are what they use to decide their score. In our scenario with the driver, they will remember the farewell the most, the greeting second, and finally the drive. But these interactions are not basic items such as from a shopping list. Each interaction can carry a psychological weight. Meaning there’s a threshold where the negativity bias can override the memory biases. We only want them to think about the last interaction where they were met with a blast of good vibes. Not any negative events that could have happened during the drive. That’s why it’s better to seem boring and neutral during the trip. Increased interactions increase the chances of making a mistake when your best move at this point is to make no mistakes at all. Then hit them with all of your positive energy right at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thank you so much. Have a fantastic day. It was a pleasure. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for the candy! Have a wonderful day! See you, bye bye!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This was so great. Thank you so much for the ride. I like your shirt by the way. Have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pour. it. on. thick. This is the only time that matters. They have a few moments to make a decision on how to rate you before they zoom off to the next client. That brief but potent injection of positivity at the end is most likely to be the thing they remember when deciding how to rate the entirely of the trip. At least if you didn’t cause any lingering negative interactions that outweigh it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I practiced these concepts for several weeks (maybe even a bit more than a month) making sure to be consistent with the approach. Treating every ride as an operation. Eventually, my Uber Rating was raised to 4.88. Which is .2 points higher than my previous peak.&lt;/p&gt;
