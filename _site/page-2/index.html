            <p>The performance of my website recently tanked. On Google PageSpeed Insights I had a ~99 rating. I looked at it recently and it TANKED down to 44. 44!

One of the most important metrics for Google Page rank and general SEO ranking is the speed of your website. 44 was unacceptable. I needed to change some things FAST to make the website FAST. I even have the charts to show how much faster it is. Wait until you see the results!</p>

Sometimes doing things programmatically is a bit easier than pointing and clicking. Or maybe you need to process a lot of files really fast, over and over again.

            <p>IT WORKS. IT. FREAKING. WORKS. <a href="/help-me-automate-my-youtube-channel/">I wrote a few months ago about this idea to automate my youtube channel</a>. Now, at the time the idea wasn’t really well defined. I decided I wanted to do something and then I had to figure out how I was going to do it. I should have <a href="/nobody-gives-a-damn-about-your-idea/">shut up and built it first</a>, but I was too excited and prematurely let the idea out. It happens to everyone. Over time though I crafted a more well-defined concept. You can see the whole evolution in this playlist in fact.

<p>Well, I finally put together something I would consider a prototype. Despite many hiccups, lingering issues, and generally losing faith in the idea I managed to put together the scaffolding for a working project. This is how it all works.</p>

            <p>When you’re building your android project locally your machines probably have a lot of horsepower. When you’re running in a DevOps workflow such as continuous integration and delivery you may not have as many resources. This can cause your builds to run out of memory. Here are some quick tips to help reduce the memory usage of your Gradle and Kotlin builds for Android development.</p>

            <p>Creating content all by yourself is really hard, so it’s helpful to use art, music, and other assets to help you share your message. If you want to monetize your content you need to be especially careful. If the content you create utilizes the copyrighted works of others then you might be in for a world of pain. Thankfully Creative Commons has been around for a few years helping content creators by creating content licenses. <!-- (1) video wrapper --></p>

<p>These licenses are easy for content creators to understand, and help them share their works for others to use in various ways. One license is incredibly useful for content creators to know about, which is the CC0 license</p>

            <p>I’m not a designer. I have a terrible sense of design really. Though I feel like it has improved considerably over the years. Hopefully, that trend continues. And while I believe through hard work anyone can become great at what they put their mind to some people simply have an innate advantage. That’s okay because collaboration is what makes every project great. I don’t know anyone who built something great by themselves. The Great Pyramid of Giza?  The internet? Kim Kardashian’s butt? All of these took the efforts of many to achieve their notoriety. People have always built off the efforts or inspirations of others.</p>

            <p>I mention pretty often that I’ve worked for a lot of companies big and small. Most of them have been amazing experiences, but not all of them have been pleasant. The worst experience by far still bothers the shit out of me to this today. There were so many wrong things happening it upsets me I stuck around as long as I did. A month and a half. What a weird experience from start to end. I found this advert looking for someone to do part-time IT work on Craigslist,  and it all went downhill from there.</p>

            <p>Really. They’ll pretend they do if they like you, but that’s the best you’re gonna get. Everyone has ideas. If a snowflake fell every time someone had a great idea we’d all be buried up to our necks in snow. And ya know what? That snow would be way more useful than the ideas that produced it. A snowperson, snow angels, snowballs - there’s a lot of fun to be had in the snow. Your ideas, however, aren’t worth a damn. And nobody cares about them.</p>

            <p>Uber ratings are a weird concept. You spend a short period of time with someone who is whisking you around the city. You might have a chat with them, or maybe you prefer to have a quiet ride. Sometimes they’ll even offer you treats, or refreshments if you’re lucky! Then, in the end, you judge each other based on a 5-star rating. No pressure. Your Uber rating is intended to give drivers some vague insight into the person they’ll be picking up, but it also has some advantages as well.</p>

            <p>Back in July of 2017, I noticed Reddit became much more - political. Lots of very specific political subreddits with various leanings and few subscribers were getting posts pushed up pretty high on Reddit. It seemed a bit strange, but it wasn’t all that much different from the previous election cycle. The difference though was in the four years since Obama won his second term Reddit’s user base exploded. The number <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/11882/number-of-subreddits-on-reddit/">of subreddits doubled</a>. There was more communities, more people, and more discussions. So it’s not surprising that many new political subreddits would pop up as well. <!-- (1) video wrapper --></p>

    <div class="play-button"></div> 
     
</div>
<p>Which is awesome. It’s good that more people are involved and aware of how politics work, and that we have the internet to share that information. Can you imagine trying to understand all the nuances to an election a hundred years ago? You cast your vote, and then things happen, and you wake up one day to a newspaper telling you who is running the country. How did that even happen? How were people capable of making informed decisions?</p>

<p>It’s not the only container registry. Google has their own container registry where you can upload your images. Microsoft and Amazon also have docker container registries. All of that is great, but what if you want to host your won docker images in a private registry. Those registries I mentioned have support for private accounts, but I’m going to reveal how you can host your own private container registry that you control.</p>

And this is always the challenge with growing up, right? I’m finding I have less to spend on hours and hours cutting up video. Doing in-depth research about a subject so I don’t get called out for being inaccurate in the comments. Reviewing, making the thumbnails, doing conversions and more reviews after reviews after reviews. <!-- (1) video wrapper --></p>

            <p>When I was in my early 20’s I somehow ended up as the “IT Guy” at this company headquarters. This was a long time ago but I still think about it sometimes. While most of the company was out in the west coast they had a headquarters on the east where all the executives worked. Though, their IT support was entirely based on the west coast. Which left a gap in the morning for available IT support. Well, that is not the kind of service these money makers are used to! They want support, and they want it NOW. So through a series of odd events that person ended up being me. That’s where the story really starts.</p>

            <p>Discord is probably one of my favorite apps ever. They started off with a simple idea and worked really hard to add features over time. Though the software hasn’t suffered from its rapid development and release cycles. <!-- (1) video wrapper --></p>

            <p>When I first started scripting, my development flow went something like this: Create a script and save it as a file. Make some adjustments I want to test and save it in a new file. Make more adjustments and save it as a new file. Rinse, repeat. I would end up with a folder full of different file versions with different names that all were effectively the same script. <!-- (1) video wrapper --></p>

            <p>When I started learning Powershell web technologies were mostly a mystery for me. I was a simple systems admin trying to make my life easier by automating things. Sure, I knew how to create a basic HTML site with some CSS, but even javascript was well beyond my understanding. Though over time I developed an interest in developing for the web, which spurred me to learn how Powershell can interact with things beyond my computer or local network. <!-- (1) video wrapper --></p>

            <p>One of my favorite ways of saving time as a systems administrator was automating the installation of printers. You don’t need Powershell for it. I often times did with simple batch scripts. PowerShell is all the rage in the world of Windows these days, so that’s why the video examples use it. <!-- (1) video wrapper --></p>

            <p>A couple of years ago my then girlfriend wanted to find a better job. I had a lot more experience going on interviews and generally traversing the drudgery of job searching so I helped her through the process. She found a job posting that interested her but wasn’t within the umbrella of her education or previous work experience. I jokingly commented that I could probably get the job before she did, and this ended up turning into a competition. I had no relevant education or work experience in this field either, but I’m a great bullshitter so I gave it my best shot. We both applied for the job with our own unique approaches. The job title was <code class="highlighter-rouge">Junior Amazing And Talented Content Creator</code>. The following is the email I sent them. All grammar and spelling mistakes included.</p>

            <p>I made a video a while ago about a small bot I made for Reddit. The goal of making the bot was to figure out a way to farm karma on Reddit. Earning the sites social currency (karma) without having to actually do any real work. Think of it as a digital reality show star. I managed to put together a very simple bot that had surprisingly successful results. <!-- (1) video wrapper --></p>

<p>It didn’t take much code thanks to some python libraries that did most of the work. The bot would repost old threads from a year ago to earn post karma and used a Markov chain based learning algorithm to generate somewhat relevant replies to comments. It wasn’t perfect, but it worked well enough far longer than I thought it would. You can see in the first video how one of the bot iterations was able to farm up a significant karma count in just a few days.</p>
